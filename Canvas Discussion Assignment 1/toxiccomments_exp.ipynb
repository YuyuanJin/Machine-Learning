      "No, Bach's taille was essentially the same as Lully's taille [des hautbois]—a straight, flare-belled tenor oboe in F. As the Wikipedia article plainly states (citing the New Grove article by Michael Finkelman), the cor anglais only came into existence ca. 1720, \"\"when a bulb bell was added to the oboe da caccia\"\". Sibyl Marcuse states that the name did not first start appearing in scores until \"\"around 1760\"\". This name was indeed drawn, according to Finkelman, from an older Germann term for the the flare-belled horns played by angels in paintings of the Middle Ages—doubtless shawms of all sorts—\"\"engellisches Horn, meaning \"\"angelic horn\"\". There is a distinction to be made (as Finkelman does) between the emergence of the instrument called cor anglais, and the (German) term \"\"angelic horn\"\", loosely applied to shawms/oboes of all sorts. The French word taille (for what it is worth) is cognate with English \"\"tall\"\", and is applied to viols (tenor viola da gamba), violins (tenor violin, or viola). The taille des hautbois'' was known in England as \"\"tenor hoboy\"\", and Purcell scored for it in 1690, a good thirty years before the invention of the cor anglais, and seventy years before the name first appears in musical scores. To claim that it is \"\"essentially the same\"\" as the cor anglais is equivalent to saying the tenor lute is \"\"essentially the same\"\" as a guitar.—  \"\n",

      "Hi John.  In answer to your question about why the UPenn study is inappropriate for the article, I'm reposting a quote from WP:MEDRS: \"\"any given primary source [such as this study] may be contradicted by another, and the Wikipedia community relies on the guidance of expert reviews, and statements of major medical and scientific bodies, to provide guidance on any given issue.\"\" \n",
      "When I first read  statement, \"\"We do not use primary sources to refute secondary ones,\"\" I was pretty confused.  I mean, primary sources are more fundamental, right?  Well, the idea is just that when the \"\"secondary source\"\" is a systematic review or the like, what that means is that the secondary source has looked at the all primary sources and evaluated their significance and rendered a scientific judgment.  The authors of the secondary source are better able to interpret the primary sources, not only because they are collecting those sources and considering them in the context of all the available evidence, but because those authors are experts in their fields.  We should expect that they understand the data better than we do, or, at the very least, better than the average reader.  Interpreting primary sources is challenging, and when the experts have already done it for us, there is no reason to foist that responsibility on the average reader. \n",
      "From my perpsective, the issue of whether it's a press release or a peer reviewed article quoted to describe the UPenn/Philadelphia study is more or less a red herring.  That study is just a single study, and we should trust the public health experts to render judgment rather than ourselves or the readership. I hope this helps answer your question.   \"\n",

It seems that the user has resurrected that page and is planning on writing up another one. Contribs shows no other edits than the project at hand. That's why I didn't know where this should go.. it's a user page and not an actual article. I've looked all over but I can't seem to find any protocol for such a situation even though I've encountered it a couple of times. When a user starts making an autobiographical page using their user page, are we supposed to let them make the page on their user page to their heart's content, and put a deletion tag on them only once they try to publish? Or do we nip it at the bud and tag for speedy deletion under db-spam? Can someone please clarify? Sorry, I'm kinda new at this stuff.  \n",

I changed the former to conform to the latter. My reasoning (besides the fact that I've always heard of this particular painting referred to as The Treachery... and never The Betrayal...) is that although the French trahison can mean either \"\"betrayal\"\" or \"\"treachery,\"\" the two English words have very distinct meanings  a betrayal is a treacherous action, and \"\"betrayal\"\" without the indefinite article refers to specific treacherous acts being committed, whereas \"\"treachery\"\" is the character trait of being prone to committing such acts  and Magritte seems to clearly mean that images can be deceptive by their nature, not that images are collectively committing a single act of betrayal. So The Treachery of Images seems to me to be the better translation.  \n",

Intermediate School District #287, Red Lake, and Cass Lake-Bena appear to be the only public school districts that have lower graduation rates.  I'm not exactly sure if some of the other school districts listed are actually charter schools or some special vocational school districts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless, I think an explanation of the school graduation rate should be listed within Minneapolis Public Schools, since they're the responsible school district, and the data should be better qualified as to exactly which districts are selected within that sampling.  (By the way, within the same edit, the editor asked for citations within the lead about Minneapolis having twenty lakes and wetlands and having a park within 1/2 mile of every house, even though those facts are mentioned later in the article.)

So for instance, in your case if you could find in-depth reviews of you or your work in newspapers, magazines, reliable websites (not blogs, unless they're affiliated with a newspaper or magazine) or some other media that isn't related to or created by you and has editorial supervision, that would satisfy the requirements.

I did not at first understand why it was so important to him, but later I discovered that he believes and argues strongly that only Yepes-tuned instruments and some nineteenth-century harp guitars are correctly called ten-string guitars. Obviously, if a twelve-string guitar is validly called that, then for example a baroque guitar might be called a ten-string guitar, and his chance of having non-Yepes-tuned instruments excluded as he wishes is remote. \n",

      "So far as Wikipedia is concerned, the main question is this: What should be the scope of the article at ten-string guitar? It seems to me that, under WP:NC, it certainly includes instruments that are built and sold by Ramirez and Bernabe to identical specification to the ones that they built for Yepes, but fitted with a different 7th string (only) to accomodate a different tuning. In fact I would also include any other guitar called a ten-string by its maker, such as the B.C.Rich Bich 10. And if we include that, then where do we draw the line? Wherever that might be, it won't be where Viktor wants it I'm afraid.\n",

      " Sorry, WilyD, but re-stating a flawed argument doesn't validate it. You're starting from the standpoint that the one true meaning of a word is the one used in a single place and, thus, all other different uses of the word are invalid. This is not true. Although movies and books have made \"\"American\"\" an understood term for \"\"from the United States\"\" in most countries \"\"American\"\" is used for the landmass and not the country. In Latin America (which comprises far more people than the USA itself) the term \"\"Americano\"\" is used for the landmass and the continents, not for a country. This may sit well because as you've implied \"\"America\"\" has always been for you your country and while this is respectable it doesn't mean your opinion is more valid that the one from those that don't share it. Incidentally, stating that only your local opinion is valid is as much soapboxing as you're trying to lay on others. Unless the Wikipedia is suddenly defined to be formally U.S.A.-Centric (and being in english obviously doesn't count) then \"\"rest-of-the-world\"\" views are perfectly acceptable. This page exists, in part, to make it clear that \"\"American\"\" is not always a demonym of the USA and this is a fact. As much a fact as U.S. citizens believen it does.\n",

Now, I am willing to accept that maybe one or two false quotes could be the result of honest mistakes or sloppy research - but when the process is repeated over and over and over again one begins to suspect that the author is doing it deliberately and intends to deceive readers. So, quite naturally, I and others have come to mistrust any quotes you may give - especially to sources that are difficult to check.

      "Hi Hertz.... I want to introduce myself. My name is Nate. I noticed that you are an active editor and participant to the article on Radio. Let me say congrats on the great work that you do. The reason why I am writing to you is to give a fair warning. A few days ago I made an edit or two to the article on the Marconi vs. U.S. case that essentially gave the radio patent to Tesla in 1943. The references I gave as you probably saw, were reliable and verifiable.  however as you also probably saw, I think I may have stirred the pot. Anything pinning Tesla to the underlying principles of radio is never acceptable to another editor on that article, Magnagr. So I wanted to warn you. I have fought him tooth and nail for over a year over this agonizing subject. I've reverted several of his unsourced edits, but he will not rest until he fulfills his agenda. His current user name is not even his first as he has several registered accounts on Wikipedia. I have a feeling that nationaliatic pride is also playing at hand here with him as I think he told me once that he was Italian. Hence, that is why he would want to only accredit Marconi as the sole contributor to radio. So it is just a warning. You and the others should be prepared to fight this with him as he will never stop. I gave up a long time ago. I have radio on my watch list so I will be following along and keeping my eyes open to the edits he makes. But you should as well pay very very  close attention what he does.

The admin status and tools are removed. It's much needed symmetry that will automatically make all areas of Wikipedia more accountable in my opinion. Admins will no longer have emeritus status. It had the most support here, so people created Wikipedia_talk:Community_de-adminship/Draft_RfC. Previously, to remove a 'bad apple' a complaint had to be made at WP:RFC to get arbcoms attention. The CDA proposal is likely to be put through RFC to get attention too. It's more about removing bad apples though - it is something that will make admin think twice about the arrogant way they act. People will think twice about whether they want to be one. Bureaucrats will think twice about the judiciousness of their final decision to check for fairness/consensus (if it goes that way, and I think it it may have to).

At the very least, it gives the appearance of Wikipedia coordinating with JIDF to promote JIDF, or cooperating with JIDF's self-promotion. (From what I can tell, our image is downloaded from the blog image by Einsteindonut 8-22-08.)

On August 23, Frank continued to intensify, but later faced shear and entered a period of weakening. However, on August 24, as shear decreased, it began to reorganize and strengthen again, becoming a hurricane on August 25. Two days later, Frank weakened into a tropical storm. Rapidly weakening overnight, NHC issued that it have been degraded into an remnant low. The area of low pressure associated with Frank was absorbed with another area of disturbed weather which later developed into Tropical Depression Ten-E.\n",

      "Throughout Central America, Hurricane Frank produced torrential rain that resulted in at least 30 fatalities, most of which took place in Nicaragua and Honduras. In Guatemala alone, damage from the system was estimated to be up to $500 million. In Mexico, six deaths were reported. A total 30 homes were destroyed with 26 others damaged. Two major roads were damaged with another road blocked due to a landslides. Several rivers overflowed their banks as well.  Losses from the storms totaled millions of dollars.

Early the next day, the depression strengthened further into a tropical storm and was named \"\"Colin\"\".  Tropical Storm Colin was downgraded to a tropical depression late morning on August 8. Tropical Depression 5 formed on August 10, with no improvement, it dissipated within 24 hours. Tropical Depression Six developed near the Cape Verde Islands on August 21, the first of the series of Cape Verde-type storms. On August 22 the system attained tropical storm status, thus earning the name \"\"Danielle\"\" The next day it attained hurricane status, becoming the second of the season and strengthened further to a Category 2 hurricane. On August 27, Hurricane Danielle strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane of the season, and further strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane shortly after.Danielle later weakened to a Category 3, then Category 2 hurricane, and later became a Category 1 Hurricane due to an eyewall replacement cycle, while avoiding land areas. It became extratropical early on August 31 southeast of Newfoundland without having directly impacted land. It was fully absorbed by a larger extratropical low on September 4 over Greenland. On August 25, Tropical Depression 7 formed east of Hurricane Danielle. Later that day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl. On August 29, 2010 Earl strengthened to become the season's third hurricane. Earl then quickly intensified to become the season's second major hurricane on August 30. The hurricane weakened to a Category 3 hurricane after an eyewall replacement cycle before becoming a Category 4 again. Earl made landfall in the Canadian Maritime Provinces, twice in Nova Scotia and once in Prince Edward Island (PEI) at hurricane intensity.

There about 2,500 sites and objects and historic districts that are NHLs, including the California Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien.  Note, the ship is included in a Wikipedia NRHP list for its geographic area, but it is not included in the Wikipedia NHL list for Maryland.

It is a rare book that you can read over and over and still find new things. About 5 years ago I read the book and about half way down the first page I realized that in the universe that Harper Lee created in this book, the actual story is very simple and innocent - Scout is just explaining how Jem broke his arm. I have always plumbed the depths of this book, talked about the profundity, it's allusion, the allegory. But this reread I reckon I saw things through Scouts eyes and just listend to what she was saying. To paraphrase - When my brother Jem was 13 he broke his arm badly at the elbow - Then she tells the events that lead up to this happening.

There is no problem to build a transistor with more than Emitter or with more than one Collector and in fact these transistor variants really exist. A multi-basis transistor would be a transistor with one Emitter, one Collector and more than one Basis. I cannot imagine how this should be made. It is thus more likely that people use e.g. two transistors in a specific way that would allow to compensate the noise. This is how the basic idea for the bipolar transistor has been discovered by Herbert Mataré in 1942 while he was working on a Duodiode that should allow to compensate the noise in a mixer for a 3 GHz Radar receiver.

As of this morning, I completed my (initial) goal of ensuing that every Boat Race had, not only its own article, but one that was either of GA or FA status:  we now have 158 GAs and 3 FAs that we can all be proud of!  It doesn't stop here, for me at least, I'm going to keep up with improving the quality of the GAs and look for more FA opportunities.  Plus, there's the small matter of 70 Women's Boat Race articles to get up and running!  But thanks again, I couldn't have done it without your help.    \n",

      "The lead states \"\"Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement deny that al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the World Trade Center buildings\"\". I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc). Ignorance must surely be bliss for these morons. Goodbye ye olde 'land of the free and the home of the brave'.\"\n",

My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake.

We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. \n",

As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. \n",
      "In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!\n",

I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent.

If the states hadn't come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation, and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the \"\"Articles of Confederation\"\" from 1775, most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 (if not sooner) and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states (which who knows if there would even be 50).  Your conceptualization of inter-state relations leading up to the 1787 constitution is limited.  A few delegates getting miffed would have changed the last three centuries of world history in ways we can hardly imagine. — 21:01, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n",

Some of them changed clear and precise to less clear and precise language (such as \"\"implies that\"\" to \"\"leads to the view that\"\"), some changed one stylistic approach to another, and some turned U.K. in to U.S. English, but the main section is this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The second horn of the dilemma (known as divine command theory) runs into five main problems. First, it implies that the moral status of things is wildly contingent—if he had wanted to, God could have made rape, murder, and torture morally right. Secondly, it threatens the  normative force of the claim that God is good—it turns into the mere claim that God is consistent, or that God approves of himself. Thirdly, it commits the naturalistic fallacy; to analyze evaluative claims (e.g., that murder is wrong) in terms of what God has or hasn't said is to reduce evaluative claims to mere descriptions of God's activity. Fourthly, it seems to make morality subjective, with moral truths determined by the mere attitudes of an individual. Fifthly, it threatens the conception of God as a  rational being. For, supposing God had a reason for forbidding rape, this reason should also be the reason that rape is wrong. Otherwise, God's decision would have been based on the wrong reason. But if the reason rape is wrong is that God has forbidden it, then it can't be God's reason for forbidding it, on pains of circularity. So God's moral decisions were based either on the wrong reason, or on no reason at all.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of this can usefully added, but some isn't really acceptable: \"\"is wildly contingent\"\" is not only unencyclopædic style, but is less clear than \"\"is arbitrary, based merely upon god's whim\"\".  It also introduces technical terms where they're not needed (as does \"\"normative force\"\" which, in addition, surely misses the target; it's not the normativity of \"\"god is good\"\" that's at issue, but its status as a meaningful evaluation).  His or her fourth point isn't very commonly raised, and is surely implicit in the other points.  The final point contains material that could be made use of, but is in fact a discussion of the article's first point.   (Μελ Ετητης) \"\n",

      "1. Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger is a 32-bit PowerPC OS, later versions adding support for 64-bit PowerPC Console Applications and 32-bit Intel processor.\n",
      "2. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard is a 32-bit Universal OS, with additional support for 64-bit applications for PowerPC64 and Intel64 processors.\n",
      "3. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is the apple's first 64-bit OS, running only on Intel processors, retaining support for 32 bit PowerPC Applications.\n",
      "4. Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is the last OS retaining 32-bit kernel for Intel64 processors. \n",
      "Before I thought OS X Tiger also supported 64-bit application for Intel64 processor, that is something I made confused. But I've also heard AIX 4.x support 64-bit application on 32-bit kernel, so I think for PowerPC architecture, that would be a common thing. But for Intel64 processor, that is quite rare, at least, as I know only Apple had gotten a try. For days, I also read something on Hackintosh on the Internet, so many hackers crack OS X kernel to adapt them onto AMD platform, even though they might hack the kernels with their patches, but I don't believe they would re-architecture for the XNU kernel. I saw many legacy AMD kernels could force hacked kernel sitting on legacy mode, applications on Long Mode. But in that environment, IA-32 applications would fail to start. That might say there might be something different between these two architectures, Intel64 and AMD64. I've also heard someone could perfectly host OS X on some virtual machines, as is known to me, none popular platform virtualizing software could cluster virtualize a guest OS, so that could tell Apple did not use VT to implement that \"\"trick\"\". So that way Apple went even further than Microsoft's WoW64. In my imagination, 32-bit kernel might provide essential OS mechanism to host 64-bit applications. Each time application loader aware of 64-bit application would be ready to run, it sets up lot of hooks onto the long mode to ensure 64-bit application would believe they are just sitting in 64-bit OS, when they requires the system all, those 64-bit hooks would grasp the processor from Long Mode back to Legacy Mode kernel to the real jobs. So in this situation a processor would switch between Legacy Mode and Long Mode much more frequently than usual. In OS X Leopard, only very few Applications, such as Chess provides 64-bit images, so most time the processor might never need to swift to the Long Mode. But in Snow Leopard, if Intel64 processor found at system initialization, all applications running within 64-bit mode. So in this situation, I confused myself, whether Compatibility Mode host the IA-32 applications, or the Legacy Mode host them? But I would prefer the latter. Even though Apple ever linked these two architectures (IA-32 and Intel64) together so seamlessly, but I would differentiate IA-32 with x86-64. Anyway, again, thank you very much for your reply.   \"\n",

You did serious damage to your own efforts to keep the article on Wikipedia. And finally, take some time to read Wikipedia policies. Start with WP:5P, and every time you see a blue link, click it and read what you see. If you can do these things, you might stand a chance of becoming a good editor.

      "I'm not the \"\"paid editor\"\" to which you referred, but I am gravely concerned by the proposal for a change to the terms of use that describes edits as \"\"deception\"\" and allows anyone to make such accusations against any editor at any time. It is impossible for editors to prove they are *not* receiving some form of benefit. The examples of \"\"benefit\"\" (which the WMF has tried to obfuscate now that some people have noticed the expansiveness of the proposal) includes things like receiving a t-shirt or a meal (any \"\"money, goods or services\"\"). Unfortunately, there's a great deal of handwaving about paid editing, but very little evidence that there's any greater bias in edits that are paid for than edits that are not.  A large number of the articles created in the latest paid editing \"\"scandal\"\" are still present, and many that were deleted still easily met our notability standards. There is not a good faith editor who hasn't received some sort of benefit or reward from their work on Wikipedia. Nobody has yet demonstrated that people who are paid do any worse at editing Wikipedia than people who aren't paid.  Meanwhile, there's lots of evidence that people who want to push a point of view will not hesitate to accuse editors of being paid or otherwise having a serious conflict of interest (q.v., the Arbcom archives). The proposal is one more tool in the arsenal for people who are motivated to go after their opponents, and does absolutely nothing at all to improve the project.    \"\n",

      "\n",
      "Shrapnel was invented circa 1800, but later that century it was used with more modern shaped shells.  A shrapnel shell is like a flying shotgun, the bullets are ejected while the shell is in flight by a small charge and they fly forwards in a cone.  The charge is initiated by a time fuze (igniferious at this period)in the shell's nose, which is blown clear as the bullets leave.  Bullet sizes varied, but by WW1 they were usually lead antimony alloy with a few hundred bullets per pound weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cannister, in contrast, is bullets in a can and the can bursts as it is fired.  This means cannister is short range.  While shrapnel was little used in WW2, cannister was developed for various weapons including tanks.  Australian Centurion tanks in Vietnam had 20-pdr cannister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cannister was always carried by British artillery in its 19th century campaigns and quite widely used. Sometimes it had to be locally assembled from old bully-beef cans. Shrapnel remained their primary anti personnel weapon into WW1, and always the ammunition of choice against 'troops in the open'. In 1945 they successfully trialled 95mm shrapnel fuzed VT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beehive, correctly called Splintex, was developed by the US in the Vietnam period.  It is a shrapnel type shell - it is fitted with a mechanical time fuze and the flechettes are fired forward from the shell in flight. It was available for 105mm arty, 106mm RCL, 90mm RCL, and probably others.  US policy was for splintex to be only fired at direct fire, ie for arty it was local defence only, presumably for fear of blinds being re-cycled by the enemy into IEDs.  However, the USSR appears to have subsequently developed 122mm and 152mm shells of this type and used them for indirect fire.\n",

I see no difference. I have quoted you exactly. Your continued assertion that I have repeatedly misquoted is slanderous. If you continue in this vein, I will be resorting to Wikipedia conflict resolution efforts. \n",
      "Your equation of \"\"allowed\"\" with \"\"mandatory is implied in the question: isn't \"\"A\"\" another way of saying \"\"B\"\". \"\"When you then add (only more so; it is inevitable!)\"\" as a further clarification of \"\"B\"\"; and your clarification of \"\"B\"\" is an exact meaning of \"\"A\"\", you are in fact equating \"\"A\"\" (mandatory) with \"\"B\"\" (inevitable). It is a logical error of equivocation when a word which can, under some circumstances and under some conditions, mean the the same as some other specified word, is arbitrarily employed as a substitute for that other specified word. This is an equivocation you continue to make with the word \"\"try\"\", which has validity when applied to natural phenomena only in a metaphoric sense, which is a usage disallowed in logic and science. I provided you with a dictionary definition of the word \"\"try\"\" which includes \"\"volition\"\", which \"\"Nature\"\" clearly does not have. Your statement that \"\"I also suspect the scenario was presented to us students just to make us think\"\" implies an awareness on your part that the case was hypothetical, which indicates that the uses of the word \"\"try\"\" (and effort with an implication of volition) was not meant literally. Need I remind you that half remembered arguments from long forgotten books (and/or lectures) does not count for evidence? The fact that the word \"\"try\"\" includes the meaning \"\"effort\"\" does not mean that these two words can be arbitrarily substituted one for the other. To make such substitution without providing a case for its validity in the specific case at hand is to commit the logical fallacy of equivocation, especially when the equivocation is being employed as a means of proving that something which can be true is true. In these cases, equivocation is also the logical fallacy of question begging. As previously mentioned, the concept \"\"Anything not forbidden is allowed\"\" has a long pedigree in various legal fields, such as - but not limited to and without prejudice - Judaism and English common law. I suggest you familiarize yourself with these arguments before continuing our current discussion.\n",
      "I have no need to address your blastocyst example, as it is a subset of \"\"Nature\"\". (i would not go down this road if i were you. If the blastocyst can be shown to have volition, it can be shown to have personhood) It is therefore covered under the general declaration \"\"Nature\"\" has no volition\"\", variants of which I have repeatedly made, and therefore does not \"\"try'. Unless you are going to try to prove that a blastocyst has volition, your example has been dealt with. I will not address each and every example of natural phenomena \"\"trying\"\" anything, except to the extent that naturally occurring sentient beings have volition. The salient feature of naturally occurring reasonable sentient beings is the fact that we are able to self-consciously intervene directly in the chain of cause and effect which governs the existence of all other natural phenomena. That is why man made laws exist in a category discrete from natural laws, and why applying laws found in natural philosophy (now known as science) to man made laws such as rights is a category error. Feynman himself, upon whose argument you rely, recognizes this. When he states that social science is pseudo-science and not science, he is placing the two phenomena into different, largely irreconcilable, categories. He denies outright that social sciences have discovered any testable laws. Your entire case rests on this category error, on your equivocation error in your use of the word \"\"try\"\", and in your equivocation error in your uses of the words \"\"mandatory\"\" and \"\"allowed\"\". You have no case; and, at this point, you are beginning to look like a troll rather than a good faith debater. i will not go round this mulberry bush with you much longer.\n",

According to the sources, Favre actually spent over an hour on the phone with Lions coaches, who were connected with Favre by then-team president Matt Millen. That story is not \"\"unsubstantiated\"\" and the use of anonymous sources is completely normal and accepted in journalism. Calling the story unsubstantiated is a violation of WP:BLP, and implying that it was incorrect because of the lack of \"\"named sources\"\" is an arbitrary standard that violates WP:NPOV. In addition, in the third source you provide, Favre admits that he did have a conversation with the Detroit executive, and that \"\"Favre said former players and coaches exchange information all the time.\"\" That doesn't disprove anything Glazer said, and in some ways seems to support it.

Prashant Bhushan (the AAP's co-founder) intervened in the BJP's Writ Petition filed through their councillor Nand Kishore Garg where this \"\"demand\"\" for CAG audit of discoms was made. The case was decided in 2011, the Court rejected the demand for CAG audit, nobody appealed this decision and it is final and binding. From Oct 2012 onwards when the AAP went political they made a series of defamatory statements about electricity sector which have all now been withdrawn from AAP's website. Many of these  old news reports refer to those AAP withdrawn statements, should they reenter Wikipedia through the backdoor of outdated sources ?  To answer your point - the AAP today (2013) is supporting BJP's demand, it is not AAP's demand for CAG audit. Both those sources say BJP and AAP are asking for CAG audit  \"\n",

Taking a look at your  as well as Behavioral targeting, Targeted advertising and Target market, I think there is enough overlap between the three that some of your content could go in each. This is a bit more difficult than adding a single addition at first. It's harder to get up to speed when you start and stop. But quickly I think you'll find that adding small changes bit by bit to different articles is fast and useful. You'll get into the habit of thinking about claims and sources, and making sure each claim is matched to a source to verify it. And you'll find ways in which articles that seem ok could really use some help. Take a look at (not to pick on it) Targeted advertising. We mention two studies, but focus on both too narrowly in terms of scope and time. \"\"controversies\"\" are mentioned in their own section but could be integrated with benefits. There is room to expand that article, though the target market article could also be improved as well.   \"\n",

You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.\n",

      "Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.\n",

If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.\n",

I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask \"\"if they can be white, then why should I not be?\"\"  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  \n",

Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.

This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.\n",

Under the basic premise that wikipedia exists for general information; In substance, Wikipedia serves a journalism-type mission, existing to educate people.   A newspaper editor doing an article on somebody who is pictured on a magazine cover, might include a photo of that magazine cover.  In essence, use of the magazine cover is but component of the larger creation of intellectual work.   The borrowed use of the magazine cover does not serve to exist as a product by itself, be it free or for a price.

I cannot make poster prints of a magazine cover and sell them individually, for in that case, the image of the magazine cover becomes a commodity by itself for sale on the open market.  In that case, I do not own the image, and cannot use it in a commercial venture.    Intellectual property, which includes photos or the written word, owned by some other person or corporate entity, can possibly be allowed to be used where it exists as a minor component used to enhance a much larger piece of work.

Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. On the other hand, the academic literature (i.e., peer-reviewed, scholarly journals) is full of articles addressing CNN's bias. They have concluded that the public perceives CNN to have a liberal bias:\n",

Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”) \n",
      ">Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”) \n",

Speaking of which, if one wanted to adapt WP:Germany's version of the table depicting importance scale, where would one paste it at WP:CRO project's page? Should I just put it on talk page until we find a better place for it?   ([[User talk:Timbouctou|talk]]) \n",

It is speculative why he did this although I again agree with pm_shef when he made the assumption it was to draw funds out of his municipal campaign fund, which seems like a reasonable reason to me.  I don’t know what the laws are on putting your name in for nomination while holding other office.  But this now seems to be a common practice here in Vaughan for example, Alan Shefman put his name in to run municipally in 2004 by-election (Councillor) while still holding another municipally elected position (school trustee), Susan Kadis did a similar thing in 2004 as well, running federally while still holding municipal office and Racco also did it in 2003 when he ran provincially while still holding municipal office.  I do have to say this practice may be legal but I see it as unethical.

Yet children are better at decoding than at encoding, a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production\"\" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 35). This fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. \n",

B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 57) Good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication, mainly nonverbal, and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. This chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. The stages include prelinguistic development, speech perception/production, semantic development, private speech, and first words. \n",
      "Also, the main idea for chapter four, Developing verbal communication and how its relevant in children's acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. A main focus is \"\"discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development\"\" for infants \"\"emerging abilities to control their communicative skills\"\" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 105). All three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children.\n",

I saw the contributions filing last week and see Vondesaar, Homer's version of Theresa Obermeyer, is in second place with less than $200 for the quarter.

Anderson's race of course was the one before McGuire made Tom stop wearing the wire and he was indicted at the end of his final year in the House. The only district which jogs my memory, unfortunately, was the kerfuffle over which district Valdez and maybe Whittier would be redistricted into in 2002. (Harris  scored?)

In your initial message to me, given at the time when you reverted all of the work I had done, you called my efforts vandalism and nonsense; I realize this is probably a auto-generated message sent in response to a flagged *accidental* event, but given that I've made several attempts to communicate to you, via this page as well as four or five times thru the original \"\"vandalism/nonsense\"\" (to which to you responded *once*, with, I might add, a tone that was less than in keeping with the tone I see when I read the messages on this page).  Nevertheless, what I was trying to accomplish with the Moline page was to take a wikipedia entry that was woefully lacking and add some real value to it  I had added the the Moline page a \"\"location\"\", \"\"air travel\"\", \"\"major interstate highways\"\", \"\"sports\"\", \"\"gambling\"\", and \"\"landmarks; and notable bridges\"\" sections.  Additionally, I completely revamped the schools section into an \"\"education\"\" section that provided internal and external links to every school mentioned.  You removed all of that.  BTW, I tried to document all of my efforts in the Discussion page, so anyone could see what I was trying to do: make the Moline page better.  Before I found it, it was little more than a glorified rundown of which neighborhood has more Mexicans than the next... and I found it simply too racist to let stand.  Yes, I also was trying to edit the Neighborhood section, to remove the racism, but also better demonstrate the real flavor and history of the town.  Thanks to you, the history and flavor is gone, and the racism is back...  Congratulations.  A final request; if you see fit to keep my efforts out of the wiki, then please be so kind as to be consistent, for I still see the results of my writing on the Moline page.  IF you are going to remove my work and have the Moline page reflect the rants of one racist hick, please be consistent and completely remove all of my work - either keep all of my work in... or none of it.

      "On the two narratives of the Creation Story (Gen. 1:1-2:4a and 2:4b-25), please notice the following inconsistencies:\n",
      "a. In the first narrative, man was created on the sixth day where man the last of God's creation. On the second narrative, notice that man was first to be created.\n",
      "b. In the first narrative, all other creatures (birds, fishes, animals, plants, etc.) created before the creation of man where man created at the same time; both Adam and Eve while in the second narrative, note that Adam was first to be created then followed by the garden in Eden and then by the animal creatures. When none proved to be the suitable partner for man, it was only then that Eve was created where Eve the last to be created.\n",
      "c. In the second narrative, the LORD GOD used the possessive pronoun I (\"\"I will make a suitable partner for man\"\") while in the first narrative, when GOD created man, GOD said \"\"Let US create man...\"\"\n",
      "d. Note that in the first narrative, God created all things using His word (Let there be...) while in the second narrative, Lord God created all creatures including man \"\"out of the (clay of the) ground\"\".\n",
      "e. In the first narrative, everyday of creation was always concluded with the phrase \"\"God saw (his creation) that it was good\"\" while on the second narrative, the Lord God said \"\"IT IS NOT GOOD for man to be alone\"\" considering it is He himself who created the man that is alone. Believe it or not, it is was a mistake. It then brings us to inquiring whether or not the creation of EVE in the original plan when the narrative suggests that had God did not mistakenly created man to be lonely, Eve could not have been created. Note further that the first choice of the Lord God to be the partner of man was animals. Upon notice of man's loneliness, God created different animals (2:19)and the purpose of their creation is to present them to Adam for man to choose which of those animals he may like be his suitable partner. Eve was actually the second choice after Adam rejected animals. Hence the question again, does God know what he was doing? It seems the creation process a matter of TRIAL AND ERROR. And true enough, EVE is a product of ERROR.\n",
      "e. Bible scholars are one in the agreement that the second narrative was written way ahead of the first narrative. Gen 2 (the second story of creation) is therefore the original creation story. But why was it written A POSTERIORI the first narrative. Please consider the same parallel confusion of sequence in the first two books of the New Testament. Mark is an older Gospel than Matthew but chronology seem to follow the same confusion between the two stories of creation in the book of Genesis. \n",

      " IRREGULARITIES \n",
      "a. On the first day of creation, God created LIGHT. On the fourth day, God separated the light that guides the day from the light that guides the night and all other stars and heavenly bodies. Question is; when did God created the SUN? Was it on the first or the fourth day. If it's the latter, what light did He create on the first day?\n",
      "b. It is not correct to call the garden Eden. The correct text states (2:8) \"\"LORD GOD planted a garden in Eden\"\". Eden is the place where the garden was planted and not the garden itself. The narrative even mentioned the location of the garden being \"\"East of Eden\"\".\n",
      "c. Note that in the 2:5, it was stated \"\"the Lord God had not sent RAIN upon the earth\"\". Question: when was rain created?\n",
      "d. Please check the absurd narrative of Chapter 6 about the Nephilim. SONS OF GOD marrying daughters of man and producing sons who were the heroes of the past and the popular men?\"\" Huhhh?\n",
      "e. It seems disenchanting to consider God a SUPREME ALL POWERFUL BEING but possesses the human frailty of REGRET; (6:6) And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.\n",

On the same day Fulton St. trolleys were extended along Fulton St. beyond Broadway, their old terminal, out to Crescent St. and Jamaica Ave. The new \"\"A\"\" line of the Inde-pendent subway was immensely popular at the time, not only because it was a novelty, but because it gave un-usually fast, direct service into New York. This Jamaica Avenue service into the Hopkinson Loop continued right [...?] to the end of 1947. The middle and late 30's witnessed the gradual isola-tion of the Jamaica Ave. line. In December of 1933 the Jamaica Central Rys. motorized their lines, ending 37 years of ¡oint operation through the old village of Jamaica, and leaving the avenue east of 168th St. to the city line without trolleys.\n",

Descriptions such as \"\"Heinrich \"\"worked\"\" in German Southwest Africa, and Hermann was a \"\"well known member\"\" of the NSDAP\"\"; this guy \"\"originated the slogan Lebensraum while in GSWA in 1910, a sympathizer who influenced the NSDAP since 1923\"\"; or even \"\"member NSDAP in 1933, founder of German East Africa\"\" (this article is not about German East Africa). Enumerating every single person who visited GSWA and later had some role in WWII does not seem especially remarkable or particularly informative and the entire section could be reduced to a paragraph or two summarizing the arguments for the link that some authors have provided. Remember, this article is about German South-West Africa - i.e. narrower in scope than German colonialism and wider than the Herero and Namaqua Genocide.  (''talk) \"\n",

I have wondered if any double entendre with the word \"\"come\"\" was intended which would certainly not be surprising among the characters of this play, although nothing of that kind is even hinted at in the dialog and if so that, even as just a title, it passed without comment in 1946. (Then again in 1938 the Cole Porter song My Heart Belongs to Daddy seems to make a subtle reference to cunnilingus (.. to dine on my fine finnan haddie .. asking for more .. etc) without any adverse results.)  There is harsh irony in this since it appears that the opposite is the case, that Hickey's wife was totally faithful and endlessly forgiving of his womanizing and drinking sprees.  This surfeit of virtue creates such self-hatred in Hickey and anger at his wife that he is ultimately driven to kill her to end their common pipe dream that each of his indiscretions will be the last.  \n",

I am a student at Drake University enrolled in a Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/Drake University/Global Youth Studies (Fall 2015):course that is striving toward taking out the systemic bias out of Wikipedia. My proposed edit is not extensive yet, but I am using my sources to explain the global side of popular music. It also explains how it is difficult to label something as popular music or not. I touched on the connection between world music and being labeled as an \"\"exotic other.\"\" I chose a couple of genres of music that are popular in different countries to explain how something may be popular in one context, but not another. The edit also discusses how the digitization of music has impacted the popular music field by allowing artists to become famous through social media. I am still not totally confident with my edit because it is very short at this point and I am nervous that I am trying to discuss different genres too in depth. I am also nervous that I am trying to make an argument out of this article because I am discussing the different countries' popular music genres.

      "Posted on 29 August, 2006\n",
      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue?

There's a real mess with the species used in sushi; Japanese snapper claims that species is used, while Pagrus major says it is the species the Japanese common name \"\"madai\"\" is applied to.

A couple species are known as red snapper on the Pacific Coast of North America, and it appears that snapper is exclusive to a single species in Hawaii and New Zealand.

Removing the anime section has NOTHING to do WHATSOEVER with diminishing the dignity or importance of Japan or Japanese culture, it has to do with removing something totally worthless (anime) from a serious, solemn topic. Its worthlessness has nothing to do with the fact it is Japanese. If someone was fouling a serious article about something from Japanese history was something equally worthless from Western culture, say, including a reference in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate about how Bruce Wayne references the habits of Tokugawa shoguns in Batman #839, I would expect it to be removed with all due haste.

      "The addition of \"\"and\"\" is good. However, a force need not be \"\"perceived\"\" to exist. The definition of \"\"acceleration\"\" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.\n",
      "Provide definition: \"\"momentum (quantity of motion)\"\"\n",
      "Hmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.\n",
      "Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the \"\"force\"\" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.\n",
      "There is a slight issue here with the sentence: \"\"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions.\"\" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a \"\"force\"\" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hi, thanks for your comments when reverting me here, but I'm not sure if you understand the confusion experienced as a helper on that IRC channel. While I do see you in -helpers from time to time, these days I rarely see you in -help itself, so it's hard to grasp where your reasoning stems from. I do welcome your explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm confused about the supposed benefit of using WPhelp### over Guest###. In any given day, I see tens, if not over a hundred, instances of the WPhelp nick. The conversation often ends up something like this: WPhelp98392 asks, \"\"Can you help me with my draft?\"\" The helper says, \"\"WPhelp89643: Do you understand conflict of interest?\"\" Then WPhelp98392 says, \"\"Sorry what?\"\" And the the helper must explain with !public. Sometimes the helpee will say \"\"I really have to look at the numbers to see who is who.\"\" On the contrary, I see few Guest### nicks, and while they are confusing, they are definitely not as widespread as the instances of WPhelp. These users came from the template  which does not supply a nick parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes a long time to manually squint to look for each WPhelp's number if not using autocomplete, and when using autocomplete, you really do run the risk of autocompleting the wrong nick. If you remove the nick parameter, just like the way it is in current freenode webchat, then helpees would ideally choose their own username as the nickname field, eliminating the amount of asking, \"\"What is your username?\"\" In short, it would be easier to deal with Guest### nicknames (the few that we'd have) than the piles of confusing WPhelp usernames when everyone literally has almost the same nickname and nobody knows what's going on, with the added benefit of perhaps helpees supplying their usernames. IRC is already a confusing environment for newbies - better to make it less confusing if possible. —  oh hello! \"\n",

So, if the player does not know where the car is placed, or the host's door opening strategy, the probability of winning by switching is exactly 2/3.  It may be that the car is always placed behind door 2 and the host always opens door 3 but, if we do not know that, it makes no difference to our (Bayesian) probability calculation, which depends by definition only on the information that we have, .

Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Ramesses. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

      "...the temple is a mass of inscribed and decorated blocks, columns, obelisks and statues of various dates, some of them even bearing the names of rulers of the old and middle kingdoms (Khufu, Khepren, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II, Senwosret I), However the majority of the inscribed monuments are connected with Ramesses II and this led P. Monet, the greatest expert on the Tanis monuments  to believe this was the site of the ancient Pi-Ramesses, the delta capital of the Ramesids. Nevertheless none of the buildings so far excavated can be shown to have been built before the reign of Pausanes I of the Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt and the inescapable conclusion therefore is that all the ramessid and earlier monuments must have been brought from other places.\n",

(In the late period a canal through this wadi enabled  ships to sail from the Nile into the Red Sea) Most scholars, though not all, identify Tell el-maskhuta with ancient Egyptian Tjeku and Pithom, (probably from per-Atum, The \"\"Domain of Athom\"\") of the Exodus and the capital of the Eighth Lower Egyptian nome.\n",

Now people start noticing this shopkeeper, and they feed the shopkeeper information to answer these questions as well as asking them things they need to know. It becomes a tightly knitted community. Things go well, until people start to unquestioningly believe what the shopkeeper has to offer. These people here, they forget that people like them are the ones feeding him information, and that whoever fed the shopkeeper this information might be just as clueless as they are. But they keep asking, and the shopkeeper keeps telling.\n",

He notices the fundamental flaw in that the advice people are getting from the shopkeeper is just as flawed as the people who told the shopkeeper the information in the first place. So Fred goes up to these people and points this out to them, but nobody seems to care.

Of course in this instance, the shopkeeper is Wikipedia. The shopkeeper's devout followers are people who use the Wiki religiously. Fred is Steven Colbert, Jim is anyone willing to follow Steven, and bricks are the messages of those willing people who think that that anyone who uses the wiki religiously, and is willing to attack somebody for calling them on it, should take a step back and look at things in perspective. \n",

Here it is http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bench_press&direction;=next&oldid;=5794667 Taking out the record would be a shame. The reason there is a difference in the Guinness record and lifts sanctioned by less notable organizations is that there are different rules on what technique constitutes a lift, if equipment is allowed to aid the lifter, and if performance enhancing drugs are tested for. If you take away all rules and judging, then anyone can claim the record. Aaron's home run record does not include the home runs he hit in the negro leagues. Josh Gibson is not the HR record holder. You can't just go out to your local gym, alert the media and complete the lift. It has to be judged by an existing set of regulations. What is a lift? Is there a pause on the chest? Can the athlete use legs to push? Can they be on drugs? Who tests? How often? Who weighs the official plates that were used? Does it have to be a standard bench? Are you allowed to put bungee cords under your lifting shirt? When is the lift complete? Lucky for us there is already an organization, recognized by the world, that takes care of all there rules and regulations. The argument is simple. If you want to be considered the greatest quarterback of all time, you compete in the NFL, the highest governing body of that sport. Powerlifting and other sports like it have International Federations and that fact should be recognized here.\n",

      "\"::: Monkeykiss, Stephen I agree with you. I will ad the socio-political implications in the main section. In my opinion, the deeds (kamma)and its effect of an individual, being completely irreversible, are stored in the collective memories of others. They pass on to others and future generations through social and biological mechanisms ( books, heridity, stories, fables etc). For e.g. Hindus and Muslims are still warring because of bad deeds of Muslims committed 1000 years ago. Thus there is no need for any etheral means for transfer of kamma from one generation to another. the rebirth concept is not necessary for the transfer of kamma. Anyways atleast one thing is certain that the same person never takes re-birth again. Kamma may recoil on the doer ( if i kill, i may get killed through revenge) or it may have an impact on others ( if i take a bribe, my children will have to suffer social stigma) or it can have effect on the future generations ( if i harm the environment mindlessly, future generations will not get clean water/air). It is not necessary that in all cases the deed kamma bounces back to the doer. Still the Law of Kamma is sufficient for maintaining the moral order as the key learning is that all actions will leave an impact which is irreversible. Thus its imperative to \"\"THINK\"\" before acting. There is no gain in regretting/praying later. Your opinion pls? with metta \n",

      "Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]\n",
      "I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10\n",

I've read the discography page and you're edit follows it to the book. However, I would like to suggest that you keep the 'additional singles section', the part with like, 'My love is Pink' and every thing else, in the same area. They are not 'Sugababes singles' for various reasons, which I can explain to you if you still do not understand. I prefer your version of the albums' section and you're introduction is much more explanatary, which I think is very useful. So I'm not critical of the whole article, just the singles section. Sorry, I really do feel bad, but it had to be done. Edits cannot be so big, because it makes it difficult for somebody to alter just one thing, like myself, who just wanted to alter the singles section.\n",

I don’t really think he would do that because you can go to prison for five years for misuse of government computer systems especially in a criminal way.  I also think a commissioned officer would have better things to do than to get involoved in any of this, but that’s just me.

As you may have gathered from my user page, I take a keen interest in lower league football teams. No offence to you, but I think this system is ridiculous. No matter how lesser known a footballer is, creating a page for them nevertheless benefits Wikipedia. The state of the lower league footballer pages on here is currently appalling, and if pages like mine keep being deleted, Wikipedia is going nowhere. There seems to be no reasonable explanation for why lesser known players shouldn't be represented. I'm from and live in England, but I don't see any reason why LOI players shouldn't have pages.

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: \"\"Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership. Really they have themselves to blame for the school-boyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association.\"\" Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr. Croft, which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in.

He had already lived for a century or more in Wind Waker. Furthermore I think Kaiju is debatable. The term Kaiju is Japanese for \"\"strange beast\"\" and as Ganon is indeed a strange fictional beast of Japanese origins he could be classed as a Kaiju. The Kaiju category is pretty much the same as the Fictional monsters category but it can also encompass creatures in mythology as well as fiction so by those standards I think the Loch Ness Monster and the classic European Dragon could be classed as Kaiju.   \"\n",

      "Hello, Wikid77 here. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing \"\"Murder of Meredith Kercher\"\", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of \"\"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia\"\". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been \"\"Adam Knox\"\" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how \"\"Donald Trump\"\" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, \"\"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed\"\" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on \"\"Amanda Knox\"\" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:\n",
      " \"\"Amanda Knox\"\" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.\n",
      " \"\"Raffaele Sollecito\"\" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.\n",
      " \"\"Prosecution of Amanda Knox\"\" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.\n",
      " \"\"Investigations of Kercher murder\"\" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.\n",
      " \"\"Murder of Meredith Kercher\"\" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.\n",
      "I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  \"\n",

This paper talks about the result: the integral over Fermionic fields is defined following Schwinger so that the action principle will work, and the result is that the determinant is in the numerator and not the denominator. This is most of Grassman integration, but without the formal anticommuting variables, which seem to have been introduced by Berezin and Candlin independently (at least according to this source). I did not read the original Berezin articles, only the 1965 textbook, so perhaps they are more complete than I originally thought. If anyone has read these, please include a summary of the contents. The real question, in my mind, is as follows:\n",

The rest can be done by summing over particle paths, with appropriate projections to deal with Dirac eqn.

This is true of the Schwinger action principle, and to a lesser extent, of Matthews and Salam.\n",
      " Matthews and Salam, like Feynman in his QEDIII paper, treat the sum over histories as green's function manipulations, without trying to formally define a calculus of anticommuting fields. They do define anticommuting sources, and anticommuting field Green's functions, but this is similar to Feynman and Schwinger. It does not have the crucial addition that the algebra of the fields in space-time makes sense, and the Fermi field integral is a sum over intermediate states.\n",
      " Khalatnikov seems to have understood the modern thing: that the Fermionic integral is a concept that is well defined. Unfortunately, I cannot access his paper. If anyone has access, please find out what is in there.\n",
      " Candlin defines the whole thing, in a very modern way. This paper is the best on the subject I have read, but it is similar to Berezin 1964.\n",
      " Berezin has some papers in the 1950s and 1960s, which seem to develop the whole thing indepedently, starting with Khalatnikov's observation. These papers are also crucial- who develops the Fermionic coherent states? And who shows that the Fermionic integral reproduces the sum over intermediate Fermionic states?\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole thing is somewhat implicit in Matthews and Salam, but also in Schwinger and Feynman. The real important development is the identification of sum-over-intermediate states with grassmann integral. If someone can point out who did what, it would help a lot.\n",

      "This page is rather a good example of how a good page can be turned into a bad one by a series of foolish edits. There never was a justification for merging Japanese and Chinese together on one page, and I should have realised from the beginning that this piggybacking of the Chinese contents onto the Japanese language page was a stupid mistake. Successive edits have rendered the page less and less readable, and the recent idiotic decision to merge the information on Chinese and Japanese punctuation, as well as the rewriting of a section which was originally entirely about Japanese into something which seems to be entirely about Chinese yet again indicates the carelessness and foolishness of very many so-called Wikipedians. I recently looked at the page about \"\"only write about what you know\"\" to find that it has been removed - Wikipedia, it seems, must be saddled with the efforts of illiterates and people who do not know what they are talking about. If I was actively involved in editing this encyclopedia, on the strength of the recent idiotic series of edits, I would revert out the Chinese language information and rename the page back to \"\"yokogaki and tategaki\"\". It used to be a good, well written, informative page. Now it is a mish-mash of badly written, confusing crud. Unfortunately what happened to this article is not an isolated example but an all-too-typical example of what \"\"Wikipedians\"\" seem to achieve - degeneration of article quality.

While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.The three-revert rule states:An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.A \"\"page\"\" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A \"\"revert\"\" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.\n",
      "If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.\"\"  \"\n",

You added a lot of references to support your claim \"\"and to some degree Javanese culture; however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture\"\". Yes, it is true they are similar to \"\"some degree\"\". But you could also say that Malays are similar to \"\"some degree\"\" with many other Austronesian cultures, of which there are thousands. If you look at the language classification  the Malay language and Javanese have over 1000 languages in the same language group. Out of those, the Malay language is in fact closer to many other languages such as Ibanic, Kendayan, Balinese, Madurese & Sundanese than it is to Javanese. So why have you mentioned Javanese specifically and not one of those other 1000 cultures, especially those which are more closely linked to Malay culture? You can of course find elements of one culture which have been adopted by another culture, but does that make them similar enough to mention?

      "In biology, evolution refers to the processes that cause some inherited traits to become more common relative to others over time. Natural selection, the most important of these, works because some traits or collections of traits will, on average, increase reproductive success, either by protecting the organism from dying before it can reproduce, or by enhancing his reproductive success directly, such as the peacock's plumage. As genes are passed on by reproduction, those that increase reproductive success are more likely to be passed on, relative to neutral or relatively unfavourable traits, and so, generation to generation, the number of organisms with these traits will tend to increase, unless conditions change so as to make them no longer favourable. Other, less important mechanisms of change include gentic drift (random changes in frequency of traits, most important when the traits are, at that time, reproductively neutral), and the founder effect, in which, if a small group of organisms become isolated from the main population, that isolated population will, even many generations on, tend to have a higher frequency of any rare variations in the founders as compared to the original, larger population.\n",

Similiar to another example, where people are \"\"just holding you down, not hurting you to rape you\"\" - holding someone down - by force - is force.

But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line.

Perhaps we could work on making it more neutral if you thought it may offend anyone?  I am originally from South Shields, which is more or less equidistant from the rival cities.  I am currently however, living in Middlesbrough.  The rivalry in South Shields is slightly more noticable since it is geographically and socially directly in the middle, and also because it has more of a mix of Necastle United and Sunderland AFC supporters.  The rivalry is especially evident in the new town of Washington as it seems (I might be wrong) to have approximately an equal amount of Geordie and Mackem residents.\n",

And not just South Vietnam used \"\"Republic\"\" in its name, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Socialist Republic of Vietnam also use \"\"Republic\"\" in their names and call themselves \"\"Republic.\"\" It might be confused at first, but later people will distingush and get use to it. I took the idea from List of countries by date of transition to republican system of government. We don't have to mention too much about the 20th century. Like other periods, the 20th century is just a small portion of the whole national history. I want make all periods to be balanced. Look at same examples such as Template:History of Austria, Template:History of India, I have to say they mention WAY TOO MUCH about the 20th century. While we only need to mention main periods.

      "Reading various Wikipedia articles, it's apparent that Wikipedia is as about as muddled in terminology as the literature is. I am clear on a concept, which Chandrasekhar calls \"\"specific intensity\"\", which fully characterizes the radiation field in a medium, without physical surfaces.  is the energy passing thru an area element dA into a small solid angle  about the normal to the area element in a small frequency band  in a small time interval dt. It has SI units of watts/meter^2/sr/hz. Apparently many people refer to this as \"\"radiance\"\". Can we please settle on a term for this concept, and use it consistently? \n",
      "\n",
      "Next is the question of a physical surface. What is the term that fully characterizes the radiation coming out of a physical surface element that corresponds to \"\"specific intensity\"\", but is only specified for radiation out of the surface, and is undefined into the surface? It cannot have the same name, because its only like, half of the specific intensity. How do we describe the fact that this radiation is independent of direction, as long as that direction is out of the physical surface?\n",

      "These are questions that need to be settled on before we can write a decent article. In my mind, I use the terms \"\"specific intensity\"\" or \"\"spectral intensity\"\" for the first paragraph above, and \"\"radiance\"\" for the second, but I don't care what names are used, as long as they are precisely defined and a case can be made that it is a common definition.   \"\n",

You've certainly got a check on the \"\"confrontational\"\", \"\"combative\"\" and \"\"non-productive\"\" criteria. Redirecting and merging are editorial decisions which can be performed in the usual manner and the threat to revert attempts to do so is truly stunning.

I haven't had anything to do with you before this so I don't know if this is an aberration or if it is how you usually behave and approach dealing with other editors and fellow admins but if it is, as emails I've received since my email to the mailing list would suggest, there are serious concerns about your behaviour that will need to be addressed. As a co- (by 5?!) Vice President of the Wikimedia NY sub-chapter you really ought to be setting a far better example and not acting like an arrogant bully-boy, standing over people who are discussing ways to resolve this, and threatening to revert good faith attempts to clean up a mess, which even you yourself have said needs to be cleaned up.

      "Plummer published in 1896. Mike Christie and I are working on Bede's article, and the general assesment of most modern scholars is that the letter is genuine. Given Plummer's age, I don't think a mention in Laurence's article about Plummer's belief is that pertient, although I am pretty sure it'll make its way into the Bede series of articles. On the canon law bit, I think the bit I've mentioned is enough to establish that it was irregular, but that opinions are divided. (Gotta love those Victorian scholars who just KNEW what was right (grins)). I guess my main problem with Plummer is that he's over a hundred years old. More modern scholars seem to think that reliance on canon law wasn't as important to the papacy and the chuech at this point in time. For Laurence the important points are that he was consecrated by his predecessor and that some folks may have felt this was irregular. Plummer seems to be more concerned with what Bede was doing and saying that what actually happened in Laurences time, I'd rather throw this information into the Historia article.  - Talk\n",

      "Posted on 29 August, 2006\n",
      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” \n",

The better recourse would have been to insert that tag about possible deletion, rather than deleting within such a short period of time. I had just created the stub.

I'm not sure I want to learn the ropes of Wikipedia politics and egos, as the obvious value of Wikipedia is compelling enough, and the ugliness of personalities warped by power within a volunteer effort is unhealthy to that effort. The impulse to characterize someone who stands up for their contribution as \"\"nasty\"\" or \"\"threatening\"\" ... the see-what-I-mean response to a contributor not aware of the emotional satisfaction some may draw from arbitrary deletions, from deliberately provoked confrontations to assure themselves of their own power, is sad. All my foregoing comments no doubt cements some of you more firmly in your smugness and self-satisfaction. Regardless of the barnacles that cling to its hull, I assert that the Wiki concept is, fortunately, apparently more powerful than the base human dynamics it nurtures  but does not ultimately tolerate.\n",

The article stub was summarily deleted three times, but after that, the vandal chose to insert an alert of possible deletion instead. This indicates to me that the proper procedure was not followed the first three times. What's the complaint procedure? My further complaint will be regarding the dynamic of portraying someone who stands up for themselves in a reasoned and civil way as having an attitude problem.

It was not possible to provide public evidence without giving further publicity to a website which engages in stalking, and which gave speculation about not only SlimVirgin's identity, but also another contributor's. And you seem to be overlooking the fact that Cyde was in a longstanding dispute with SlimVirgin, so obviously should not have been the one to block. See also . This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log.

JHP, if you're talking about the 14:54, 27 June 2007 24.209.30.113 (edit #141014976) entry that I reverted, it is because the content was taken directly from the Incidents page without any regard for either (a) including the references themselves, or (b) not following the WP:BLP policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident.  If you're talking about the 22:32, 2 July 2007 Realkyhick (edit #142152748) entry that I reverted, it's because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page, and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time.  If you're talking about your edit #147620955 from the 29th, that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page, poorly included, and badly placed in the article  while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident, including it in the intro section isn't really appropriate either, especially as it (in essence) duplicated information that was posted further down the page.

This SOURCE is only 1 day old; Two general partners at the venture capital firm (John Doerr and Beth Seidenberg) interviews about the gender-discrimination lawsuit. You can add it to the WIKI. It mentions there was a very good work relation ship with Ellen Pao while she was Chief of Staff. A relationship trusting enough to promote Ellen Pao to an partnership/investor. It's a situation that didn't work out and left some hurt feelings in the process. Some of you are complaining about \"\"intense criticism\"\" in the WIKI, but these are direct NEWS sources. A growing number of news sources, illustrating the story.

In the case of Mike Sharperson, Social Security records suffice so you change his birth year to 1960 - even though all other sources say 1961.  But, in the case of Larry MacPhail, Social Security records agree with all other sources that his birth year was 1890 so instead you use his draft records - apparently the only source that shows 1888 - and change all references to his birth year to 1888.  Except in the case of MacPhail - as well as Casey Stengel and Chief Bender - his own gravestone disagrees with you (yes, there is a picture here)!  Doesn't that mean that MacPhail faked his date of birth for the draft and not the other way around?!  And Stengel's fake birth certificate was the one that said 1889?  You say Chief Bender's sister found his birth certificate in 1942 and it said he was born in 1883.  Then why did he have 1884 put on his gravestone when he died - 12 years later?!\n",

If you're really writing a book using this tactic - and without pointing out that those dates are the lone exceptions - then you should really be ashamed.  And if your editors and publishing company don't point out the error of your ways, they should likewise be ashamed.  And if you think that research like that is going to be permitted on Wikipedia, then you are mistaken.

The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.\"\"\n",

The \"\"aspects\"\" division gives people the power to understand the influence of the liberal tradition by comparing it to other ideologies with these categories in mind. The perfect example is that of \"\"social conservatives\"\" who (can be) economically liberal without being socially liberal.\n",

I suspect that 'ponde' is cheyanne or sioux as talking to those people its their word, but Sturt may very well have made that name up and I suspect he did.  Some Sioux etc were very much in the Gundagai area but Sturt may have known the word before he went downriver.  It seems he left a ponde downriver also.  Another aussie word that is native american is 'creek'.  We do not blink at its use, ever. Sturt did record the pondebadgery word.  What pondebadgery refers to is appropriate and is in context and association, just the vowles etc do not sound to me that ponde is a Wiradjuri word.  NOTE:  I did not note that it was a wiradjuri word. I only note Wiradjuri words if they have a known ethnology.  Sturt records Warby being at Pondebadgery.  This is the g.g.granddad of Ben Warby who holds the world water speed record.  Warby does not record 'pondebadgery' nor does anyone else in all of Australia's story that I am aware of and I have looked extensively. Just Sturt does though badgery or budgeri is previously recorded.  \"\"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery\"\" is more correct than what it has been edited to as that edit seperates Sturt from the word when no one knows that at all so its factually incorrect and should not be done as its making something that was correct as it stood, into fiction.

      "Thanks for your suggestions, Hpvpp. I can tell that you really care about this issue. But honestly I think it's a terrible suggestion. Structuring discussion of linguistic relativity around the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis on one hand and fictional languages on the other (with or without splitting) would be like structuring discussion of Special relativity around electrodyanmics on one hand and fictional space ships on the other. Yes, notions of linguistic relativity have been important in some sectors of speculative fiction, just as notions of faster-that-light travel have been in others. That does not mean that fiction plays a comparably important role in the philosophy of language nor in physics. As Maunus says, this article is, and ought to be, about the linguistic and philosophical treatment of various notions of linguistic relativity, not about their uptake in fiction, among creators of constructed languages, or in other creative applications.\n",

I mean, where does she get off saying the police surmised Peg died on Sept 18? What's her source? She have the police report? I do! The police surmised no such thing! The death certificatenot my original researchsays \"\"Date of Suicide September 16,\"\" as does the police report, Coroners Report, and Inquest. The date of death given as September 18, 1932, is because that was when she was DECLARED DEAD by the coroner. If the coroner had not examined the body for another hour and eleven minutes, Peg's death date would have been recorded as September 19, for he would have declared her dead at 12:01 AM, yet the date of suicide would remain September 16, for the coroner knew the rate of decay. That was the way it was done in 1930s Los Angeles....The coroner knew what he was doingGwen didn't. I have official documents provided to me by the City of Los Angeles, yet Gwen would rather what?

At any rate, the article stood on its legs for many months before Gwen brought the hatchet. I care about Wikipedia, too, and I am concerned about unverifiable entries making their way into any article. I fully remember when Wiki was the laughing stock of the Internet and scholarship in general. Did you see how many pages Gwen used up in the \"\"View History\"\" and then had the nerve, the gall, to tell me she \"\"tweaked\"\" it? She didn't tweak it, she rewrote the damn thing.

(2) I wonder if there is any better way to organize the listing of the numbers of ships.

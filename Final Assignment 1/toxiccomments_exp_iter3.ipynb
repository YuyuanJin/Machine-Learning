Prior to that time it did not exist, and it has no meaning other than whatever meaning the IAU is pleased to confer upon it. When Wikipedia uses the term \"\"dwarf planet\"\", it means whatever the IAU means by \"\"dwarf planet\"\", regardless of what any other person may use the term to mean. The statement that there are \"\"hundreds or thousands of dwarf planets\"\" is not accurate; there may be hundreds of candidate objects, some of which might some day be accepted as dwarf planets, and there may be thousands of objects yet to be discovered which might be candidates for being labelled dwarf planets, but at this moment, there are only five objects which actually are dwarf planets. Because \"\"dwarf planet\"\" is an arbitrary label, we cannot reasonably say that, say, Sedna or Quaoar are dwarf planets; they would only become dwarf planets at such future date as they may be named as such, which depends upon obtaining accurate data as to their size, mass, composition, and shape, which is not as yet available. To say definitively that there are dwarf planets other than the five that have been named goes far beyond what Wikipedia is entitled to do. At most the project can say that certain objects, at some future date, might be designated as dwarf planets.  \"\n",

This was a group of friends who had worked together on peotry, prose and cultural conscience from the mid-forties until the term became popular natuionally in the late fifties. The group consisting of Kerouac ... Neal Cassady, William Burroughs ... Herbert Huncke, John Clellon Homes ... Allen Ginsberg, myself; we met Carl Solomon and Philip Lamantia in '48; encountered Gregory Corso in 1950, and we first saw Peter Orlovsky in 1954.\n",

LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.\n",

Some effects of the aforementioned groups refreshed the bohemian culture which was already a long tradition (in film and still photography, Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie; in music, david Amram; in painting, Larry Rivers; in poetry publishing, Don Allen, Barney Rosset, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti) extended to fellow artists such as Susan Sontag and Norman Mailer.\"\" etc.\"\n",

They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.\n",

The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6\"\" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.\n",

The 'Heyland factor', or it's unidentified equivalent, is how you derive transformer or motor from short-circuit and open-circuit measurements, which is a classical approach to doing it and which Leakage inductance article has been trying to describe incorrectly for several years. This stuff is proposed in Leakage inductance article, not in Transformer article proper. I am not proposing anything major in difference in Transformer article proper. Right now, everything about Leakage inductance is nonsense, so the alternative is to scrap Leakage inductance article. But there can be no doubt about the substance of the derivation per se. One may quibble with the presentation and the naming of this stuff but not with the substance. I will address these issues in proposed changes to Leakage inductance article. You are the one who suggested to start with ideal transformer and to first with linear (cum real) transformer. So back to the question: How do you fill the gaps between ideal and real?

The first part seemed to be putting me in my place  when you could have written a note on my talk page.  Now that you've explained your position, I understand.  If you find any others that I've uploaded, it's not necessary to post anything on my talk page.  I understand what you're saying, although I disagree with one part of it regarding film publicity photos, which were mass-distributed, sometimes without registering for copyright.  We don't know which are free and which are not, so it's not something that can be pursued, and I wouldn't try to claim any specific image falls into that group.     I still see problems with the Blondie image.   For one, it doesn't show anything vital that the article couldn't do without.  They're all living people, one of whom isn't even notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and they're not doing anything.   It only shows what they look like.   If it was a significant moment and if the photo showed them doing something that could not be adequately described in prose,  I could understand.  Regardless of what brought them together, the photo itself gives nothing except to show what they look like.   Given the degree of thought you've given to the actress photos, I don't understand why you accept a fair rationale saying \"\"they cannot be brought together because they live in three separate areas of the U.S.\"\" which is a false statement, contradicted by common sense - there are numerous ways they could be brought together - and by the very existence of the photo.  I'd accept a rationale that justified its use, but not that.  Still, you said you may even nominate it for deletion someday, but that it's not a priority, so you're obviously not completely convinced.  Anyway, I understand your viewpoint on the actress photos, so thank you for taking the time to convey your thoughts.  Regards.    \"\n",

Three years later, in May, 1945, I was a replacement joining this Division where I earned my combat badge in June of that year. June 30th did not see the end of combat for this Division. I was an 18yr. old replacement and a member of Company D, 145th Infantry Regiment when we were sent deep into the Cagahan(Sp?) Valley of Northern Luzon with the assignment to thwart the fleeing soldiers of Japan from reaching the dense forested hills bordering that Valley. Our Company was engaged in many firefights with these retreating Japanese army units. My last combat missions were ended soon after the Dropping of the atomic bombs on the Japanese main land in early August. While my combat experience was very limited, I did come face-to-face with my own mortality during these few months of combat experience. When I came home in 1946, I remember the resentment I felt that my parents had to come with me before I could register to vote in my first National election. I was still under the legal voting age of 21.\n",

Simpson's murder case at Wikipedia is entitled O. J. Simpson murder case. Calculating numbers of countries is tangential to the legal aspect, as explained above  basically, most free countries that had relations renewed relations, never having recognized the legality of the forcible annexation. Many countries did not have relations prior to the occupation, because many were not sovereign back then (e.g., India was part of the British Empire, etc.  a list is available here ). I have nothing against including information on who did and who didn't recognize the annexation within the article, and the article should include information on the \"\"lameness\"\" of continuity, too. But if you would emerge from the innards of this debate a bit  a person interested in the occupation (or even the argument that there was no occupation) would generally expect an article like this, with a title like this. It's a frequent search term. One includes denial in the Holocaust entry, and there are separate entries on Holocaust denial and even Criticism of Holocaust denial  but this does not mean that we agree with Holocaust denial, does it? The occupation of the Baltic States is not universally agreed upon, no  but not too many things are universally agreed upon. Presenting the prevailing view and serious alternate views is what an encyclopedia is supposed to do. You write: Saying Baltics were not annexed is pure nonsence and extremist POV. Nobody here said that the Baltics weren't annexed  what some here are saying is that they were illegally annexed whilst under occupation, and that is indeed the prevailing view. Please follow the links I gave. That some are in denial really does not matter. Start an article on \"\"Denial of the occupation of the Baltic States\"\" if you like.  09:05\"\n",

I've only recently discovered this author; the one volume of his I read, Shifts, was brought home from (and subsequently returned to) what we call the \"\"pass-around\"\" box outside the library door, filled with individuals' discards that don't pass the librarians' muster for inclusion on the limited-space English-language shelves. (Resource restrictions prevent me from acquiring books by choice; happily, I'm largely content to make do with what comes my way.) I was impressed with this collection of short stories, a favorite genre of mine, and likewise noted the author's recognition as a poet and dramatist. Imagine my indignation, then, to discover he had no page in the English-language Wikipedia! As with other authors I consider worthy of promotion, I took the time and made the effort to create a page with what I could find on the Web, and was gratified to subsequently it expanded by fellow editors.

      "Binksternet's paranoid and frightening theory propounded about Geraldine Edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.\n",
      "Other Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.\n",
      "The San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said \"\"Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,\"\" a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.\n",
      "All of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) \n",
      "Whatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase \"\"Legend in his own mind\"\". Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject.

Describes the Chagi family as of Kshatriya caste (bahujakula) and gives the donor’s genealogy.\"\"  > from this inscription We derive Chagi family as belonging to Kshatriya caste - There is only Chagi royal family in entire telugu society, i.e Chagis of Kshatriya Raju's who ruled Krishna dist, later they ruled Peddapuram kingdom also.

      "Thank you so much, Abstrakt, this is very helpful! I sometimes take entire months off, so don't worry for taking a few days to respond. And yes you're right, the Shunzhi Emperor is referred to as \"\"šidzu eldembure hūwangdi\"\" in Manchu documents written after his death, just like he is named Shizu 世祖 in equivalent Chinese documents. These are the emperor's temple names. But I've seen a few Shunzhi-era documents in Manchu, and the date is marked as \"\"ijishūn dasan, Xth year, Xth month, etc.\"\" Since the Wiki conventionally use reign names to refer to Ming and Qing emperors, \"\"ijishūn dasan\"\" should be good. I also find that form more interesting than \"\"šidzu eldembure hūwangdi,\"\" which after all is a transcription from the Chinese (\"\"šidzu\"\" = Shizu 世祖) followed by a generic title that applies to all Manchu emperors!

'People have died after taking mephedrone' is intended to summarise \"\"mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases\"\". Likewise 'some deaths the media attributed to the drug were later determined to have been caused by other factors' is summarising \"\"The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone, but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes. In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone. Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone\"\". Both parts are important and should be mentioned in the lead and if you read the references you should realise that this is exceptional to mephedrone as deaths were over-reported and mis-reported by the media - comparisons with other topics are irrelevant. I agree that it is a bit weasely, but how else to you suggest that that section is summarised? WP:LEADCITE is very vague about whether citations are required and when I wrote the lead I erred on making it easier to read rather than ensuring that every fact was supported by a citation there (Wikipedia:Citation_overkill). I could easily copy the references from the main article to the lead for this sentence, but then someone will likely come along and complain that other sentences don't have citations... IMO this is a waste of time when readers could just find the relevant citations in the main body of the article.   \"\n",

He does this by inflating the casualty figures listed. He has used several methods to do this. Firstly, by changing the numbers given by sourced material, thereby falsifying it. Secondly, by inventing sources and or/citing them falsely. He refuses to engage with other users when asked detailed questions about this behaviour, but instead makes personal attacks (specifically calling users loyalist paramilitary supporters) and threatens to get other editors banned from wikipedia. This behaviour has been going on for nearly a year now and is hugely disruptive to the articles in question. This is not only due to the factual inaccuracies and POV he inserts, but also because his reverts delete all the work done on the articles since his previous edits. Additionally, his constant reverts have had the effect of re-posting copyrgiht material that had been removed. Finally, Devin79 has also defamed a living person, Irish journalist Henry McDonald, although he has not engaged in revert wars there when his edits were removed. Jdorney \n",

So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5].

I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored.

This gives to us a better reason than gravitation can for the elliptical orbit of the planets instead of the circular. It also gives us some light on the mystery of the tides, the philosophy of which the profoundest study has not solved.

      "Hi, I have received notice that the page I began about Jesse Ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article. First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant.\n",

How on earth are the rebels resisting? Also, lol, they make the ISIS pigs hold only 10% of Saker Island for MONTHS now, how on earth they can't take control of that small area that Masdar and Lucem claim they don't hold? Also, Masdar numbers are as far-fetched as SOHR's. Really, they claim 200 Nusra(not counting other rebels) deaths in Shaykh Miskin by 10 of November. After that, we had over a month of a bloody battle, so likely the rebels suffered even more deaths, and they also said that hundreds more of Nusra fighters we're injured. But the estimated number of Nusra numbers in Daara is 3.000. How would they hold together after losing effectively 1/6 of their forces in TEN DAYS, specially since they battled in Shaykh Miskin for a month after that. Yeah, all forces that lose 1/6 of their forces in a single battle, that only in 10 days, are capable of fighting the same battle for a extra month and still be existing. Makes much sense.

In the 90s, \"\"hip hop\"\" described Gangsta Rap, as performed by Snoop, Dr Dre, and 2Pac.

I have argued, but to no avail, that when a free image turns up (there is no a priori reason why a free image should at all become available at any foreseeable time from now), that event renders my present copyright statement invalid, at which instance the present image must be replaced by the available free image.

Everyone who posts in Wikipedia is a real person; we use log-in identities to protect our privacy and our private identities.  If someone uses his or her real name in Wikipedia, it is published in this version of Wikipedia and all over the internet.

Although I have continually posted my concerns in good faith, I have been continually set upon as if I have not.  I assure you that since first contributing to Wikipedia as \"\"NYScholar\"\" in June 2005, I have done my best to learn about and to follow Wikipedia's obviously-convoluted and often contradictory editing policies and guidelines, which are frequently edited and changed by those editing Wikipedia, and often vandalized.  I have done my best to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and yet be forced (demanded) to respond to in my own view entirely-unfounded and false charges that I have not been editing in good faith.  Despite my requests for compassion and understanding because I have other important non-Wikipedia work to do (which have been in the \"\"N.B.\"\" above and were only edited out in the past two days in response to Shell's comments about the \"\"N.B.\"\" section), I was continually being forced by administrators and others to reply to them in what I increasingly regard as a dysfunctional AN/I based on both misunderstandings and violations of the AN/I instructions by the user who posted it and by the continual references to a previous AN/I by others, including administrators, extending it when it should have been expunged.\n",

      "You will never get anywhere with the likes of Keepcalmandcarryon, Mastcell, Nunh-huh, etc. Going into the archives of some of the articles here on AIDS and HIV, I found that some of these people have been working, full-time it seems, on keeping these pages biased for years, and that they don't allow any edits which provide alternative information to the orthodox theory that HIV=AIDS, or anyone attached to these theories. They can be illogical, bullying, they will name-call, they will call any persons with honest questions denialists, and they will use any and every strategy no matter how ugly to keep these pages the way they want them to read. They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die. I wonder if these mercenary editors here have any idea that their policing of these pages could be leading to actual deaths in the world, as thousands of people take poison in a desperate attempt to save their lives, when they are not even sick.\n",

What's more, the image in the infobox comes to us from the self-published book of a Holocaust denier - although it was uploaded, I presume, in good-faith - who cannot claim PD for the images, but (as he does) only for the text. I presume the PD release for the text is there to help him popularize such nonsense (\"\"read me, copy me\"\"), but the images are still copyrighted by their original authors, from whom the author took his images without proper credit. Unless I see some serious arguments as to why to keep the images, sometime in the near future, I myself will visit wikicommons with a couple of deletion requests. (The only reason why, in an earlier version, this article was introduced by the Antonescu-Ribbentrop photo is that it is the only such portrait yet that is clearly released into the public domain.)   \"\n",

In observing this article, and comparing in to, McCain's, Sarah Palin's (see typical example here   and other Republican office holders biography, the Republican ones are filled, with all sorts of negativity, red herring,  and plain old guilt by association.  Now if considering the precedents and standards, as they were up held on this article and vigorously defended by those with like \"\"Scjessey\"\" and \"\"Wikidemon\"\" and others I will conclude these are considered to be typical and reflect the consensus of those on Wikipedia.  As such I will take it a step further and  apply these precedents of style and content or what I would like to coin the \"\"Wiki-Obama standards of political content and style\"\" on Republican office holders biographies, with equal and fair vigor as it has been applied here on the Obama's Biography.\n",

      "No flaming intended, I just want balance to come to this subject.  Explain to the world, how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal, is in any way, shape, or form, NPOV.  You know, Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject (e.g. Oliver Stone's Alexander (film)).  They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.  To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant, just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo.  Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew.  Whenever I watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, homosexuality did not come to mind.  Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena \"\"get nasty\"\" with their traveling companions, but that's beside the point.  You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people \"\"narrow\"\".  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.  Out of all the characteristics of the Hellenic people, founders of Europe, you had to claim that their homosexuals were most importanteven iconic representations of the West.  Nobody said they were all straight either, which is something you have to admit.  Homosexual revisionism is not fact.   \"\n",

Almost everyone I know thinks of the Kapiti area as part of Greater Wellington.\n",

In reality, in spite of the classifications, Wellington remains the second largest Metropolitan Area in New Zealand, by my calculation the population including the Kapiti suburbs is around 415,000, still around 30,000 more than Christchurch. \n",

We cannot possibly list all the criticism, so what's the point of listing any? We should just describe what's significant about someone (i.e. why they have an article here) and let others decide on the merits of their actions and views. The same goes for people significant for their strong religious views. List those views, and let it stand.

      "I am not too surprised that this new section is upsetting some editors. Nevertheless, I absolutely disagree with claims that the information presented is biased, false, or unverified. Regarding neutral POV, what about consensus POV? Information about human rights in Tibet falls into 2 categories; in one the sole source is the Chinese Government, and in the other side is every other source (including UN, HRW, Amnesty, RSF, etc, etc….). \n",

      "I'd agree entirely. However, some of the wording could probably made more neutral while preserving the facts. For instance: adding \"\"According to Human Rights Watch, a non-government organization, Tibetans are denied...\"\". (Which is done for several other sentences). It might also allay some concerns if sources could be found from a less-biased source. I'm not really disputing the accuracy of HRW or FreeTibet, but it's rather harder to argue that an article from the New York Times suffers from a bias. Just my $0.02.   \n",
      "It is essential to state where the sources is retreated from in a particular statement.  In a controversial section like this, its important to differentiate the origin of the source, because many links cited in this section came from a particular organization.  \n",

      "I should add however, that which facts ought to be included is up for discussion under WP:UNDUE. However, since the vast majority of English press regarding Tibet deals with human rights issues, I don't think it can reasonably contested that a \"\"Human rights\"\" section ought to be part of this article. \n",
      " I am the one who started this section. I did it in good faith, and considered it to be an initial draft for further development. I tried to group the statements together into a logical sequence, and also tried to accurately link the statements to their supporting references.

Your speculation about the credibility of the 9/11 Commission on issues not addressed by Able Danger is just pure speculation.  From someone, I might add, whose own credibility is very much in question.  I will continue to delete references to Able Danger until someone establishes their relevance in a meaningful way, not through a string of random speculations barely tied together by a thread like the above.  And again, let us please remember that the 9/11 Commission is not the issue here anyway.  The commission is cited but the pieces of evidence they look at are all pieces of intelligence brought out by other agencies.  As for the arrest of Iraqis in Germany, again, if you find evidence or even authoritative speculation tying those arrests to Able Danger we can consider it - otherwise it is just a string of increasingly bankrupt attempts at pseudo-logic. 05:11\n",

      "I just found that I am unblocked now. This block reminded me of Hkelkar,Bakasuperman combination who used to get me blocked very often in very similar fashion. The longest block so far. Perhaps, longer ones are in the way! People have already threatened it on my talk page. Well, If I get challenged I feel more determination. One shocking fact I recently learnt is WP:ANI is up again. We had got it deleted earlier. It was WP:AN/I if I remember correctly. I had proposed, it has the potential of becoming another Fundywatchlist, which many others accepted and it got deleted. For those who are unaware of what Fundywatchlist was, I would like to elaborate, it was a page on wikipedia itself to discuss the ways to harass some users and POVise the pages in the name of cleaning and improvement. Members included were some Indian Admins, and a bunch of like minded users, who used to discuss whom to target and how to achieve their ends. It got deleted, and slowly the admins involved were shown the way out. However, these people started getting smarter, and found user:Yellowmonkey alias blnguyen, an American Vietnamese, as their mask. This guy was very popular among Indian circle and was acknowledged as good troubleshooter, though I always smelled something different. Hkelkar was in his good books, and once in a rv war on Kancha Ilaiah, article, where hkelkar was hell bent on writing a libellous term in lead, he went to the extent of not only protecting the page rv in his favor, but also shamelessly declared, \"\"I have protected the page for you\"\". After that Ben W Bells Dispute Resolution started, who neglected my request to remove the term first, saying he cannot unprotect the page protected by a different admin. Majority ruling made Hkelkar, the winner. No, actually He didn't win, I left the page forever, because everybody was against me there. Blnguyen wrote a note there, just below my unprotect request, \"\"I didn't know it has stuck\"\" However, what happened afterwards, is more interesting. I requested, checkuser on Hkelkar and tagged him as sockpuppeteer. Blnguyen, ritualistically, blocked me for bogus tagging - you can check my block log. and, lo, both checkuser and arbcom decision was in my favor. Since then blnguyen has never been shameless enough to look into my eyes. I could have raised finger on him during arbcom, though I dropped this idea later on, because one thing was evident Blnguyen was not a bad person, he was into bad company. Going through the talks above, I get the same feeling about many non-indian users here. \n",

If you are quoting jafferlot, he didn't use the word claim. If you are quoting Hiralal & Rusell, they are very much clear that Ahir is just a corruption of word abhira. From where this idea come s I would like to be educated. I find it rather funny, because you are saying they are claiming what they actually are and that too from central asia!!! I couldn't get the head and tail of it. Some indian languages still call them abhira. Translate this into one of them and sentence becomes Abhira claim descent from Abhira. What a nonesense!\n",

You are yourself using it interchangeably in the article.  But why you are confusing the readers, by artificially creating two titles. You cannot adopt a convention which is not in sync with real life usage. Sanskrit word Krishna can also be written as Krsna with few dots above and below different alphabets, however, they are still same. If you want to differentiate, present day Yadvas from ancient ones, better tag it as scriptural or mythical. \n",
      "3) Saying present day yadvas came into existence only after sanskritisation movement. Now tell me didn't British census record them as Ahir and gwal in different parts. Were they not Yaduvanshi before that??  Isn't it true that ancient sanskrit text, Amarkosa, calls Gopa, gwal and ballabha are Abhira synonym, and you still say they are a bunch of unrelated people. In fact we have many evidences for equating ahir with yadav and M.S.A. Rao summarizes them into two categories:1) Historical, and 2) semi-historical. I would like to learn why you keep on removing them. I didn't wrote, MSA Rao says this, because he is not the only one, so it was unnecessary. If you want you may dig deeper into earlier version of the article, it contains the link to snippet view of his statement too. \n",

      "The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.\n",

      "As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown. 110.174.147.166  \n",

      "On 28 November 2010, UK Green Party leader and European Parliament member Keith Taylor wrote to the Indian government seeking the release of Sharmila and the repeal of the AFSPA. Her main supporter in the European Union is Sir Graham Watson KB MEP  chair of the India/EU delegation of MEPs. He has consistently made interventions on her behalf most recently to Dr J Bhagwati Indian Ambassador to the EU who responded on 1 July 2011 to his request to respond to the death threats made against Irom Sharmila. Indian Ambassadors reference BRU/AMB/48/2011 Embassy of India, 1050 Brussels. He responds only that he understands that Irom Sharmila is a hunger striker and that the modification of AF(SP)A is under consideration. Previously in April 2011 Sri Graham Watson and the EU delegation had tried to visit Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the Indian Authorities. They visit each year this year they were allowed to visit, Delhi, Patna and Mumbai. Although Keith Taylor did write three letters on one occasion he has never responded to further input. Sri Graham Watson and other members of the EU delegation do always respond to further requests for help. For example a Dutch member of the India EU delegation Peter Van Dalen whose special interest group is Dalit and subaltern groups released this press statement for publication at the gathering at her tenth anniversary of fasting in November 2010  Smt Sharon Bowles MEP sent Sharmila a personal letter of support which is now with Sharmila.

But the learned Romans and other learned practioners of Latin did recognize Step 1 of counting the Latin letters and giving significance to it. This example of counting the number of letters and giving it importance and can be traced back to Plato's use of \"\"God is ever a geometer\"\", which in Greek - equals 3,1,4,1,5,9 or 3.14159 pi. - Brad Watson, Miami, FL 64.136.26.22  \"\n",

You did not specify user names, but you did specify users by their arguments: \"\"unhelpful meta discussion about the use of T: prefixes in general\"\", but when an editor writes , incorrectly, you do not use that argument. This way my arguments were rejected explicitly in one stroke, while wrong arguments are still weighing in. The same can be said for the overstated \"\"consensus\"\": not thrown out (more on this later). You also have used the comment that it is , which is a malversion of my arguments (you did not find). From all this I feel & read that only my arguments were targeted off-topic.\n",

      "... not whether T: redirects in general should be deleted. This is bs. I reasoned like: \"\"a T: redirect is bad in mainspace, so these twelve should all be deleted\"\". Plain sound reasoning. I did use argumental examples in some places, but I did not, nowhere, argue that other, non-listed Rs are to be deleted. It was someone else who expanded it into too wide  not me. Keep'er \"\"Technical 13\"\", I admid this is a third Keep'er, invokes an \"\"WP:NS#Aliases\"\". But this time it must be deemed not too general (I can not follow, but I must conclude that). If \"\"Keep\"\" individual pages were reasoned to be kept, why not conclude the the others are to go? Requirement for individual mentioning only works one way?\n",
      "Also, in one point you complain that there was \"\"no discussion about the individual redirects\"\". Well, that could also be because an argument applies to the whole list (a logic you disallowed explicitly). Then, when I do point to individually addressed Rs (here above, linked), you do not see a contradiction in that. Even worse, when I do demonstrate there are Rs named specifically, you respond here with but not everybody agreed with you. This does not undo my point that individual templates were addressed. Confusingly, here you are jumping the reasoning.\n",
      "As was repeatedly pointed out the most recent times that it was discussed the consensus was that at least some were useful and that there was no consensus for a prohibition on their creation or use. Here it is you introducing arguments from *outside* the RfD list at hand. Earlier RfD's outcomes as an argument? How am I allowed to argue with that? WhenI use an argument involving general sanity (not even stepping outside this RfD), it ends up in the bin. And, above I linked tot two more recent R deletion conclusions (a G6 \"\"non-controversial\"\" speedy! March 2013, and a full RfD-list deletion in December 2010), that contradict your reasoning. Also you write T: as a prefix or the use of such prefixes in general in the closing and XfD not RfD here. That is an expansion of the topic beyond RfD. Why is that allowed?\n",
      "It doesn't matter how long ago a consensus was reached - it applies until there is a newer consensus formed, it doesn't somehow expire.and Consensus can change, and older consensuses are often more likely to, but ....  No  was reached. Repeat: there is no consensus. You are repeating an editors' 2007 injection -not a conclusion- into an essay. With that, indeed it is irrelevant how long ago the irrelevance was written: today it is still irrelevant. II note that you took over this bogus claim from an editor. As for old or new 'consensus': can an admin research & report how many T:-redirect were deleted without RfD, over the years? Of course, they leave almost no trace for non-admins. But I'd like to see the numbers & arguments for all T:-redirect deletions since template space was introduced. Some 'consensus' must be visible in there too. There is no consensus. So there is no argument from that  non-existent consensus. And don't blame me for introducing \"\"history\"\" as a reason. \n",

I've mentioned the Frymer and Skrentny source twice now, quoting it the first time, yet you can't seem to recall something that's literally only a few responses above your last reply. That's pretty telling, espcially since I bolded parts of the quote and I pretty rarely bold things. So we have 2 sources from Lassiter, 1 source from Feldman, 1 source from Frymer and Skrentny, and here's another one from Bedolla and Haynie, published by Routledge in 2013, called \"\"The Obama coalition and the future of American politics\"\". In it, they say \"\"By many accounts, the southern strategy, for decades, has been a successful tool for increasing white support and turnout for Republican candidates throughout the South. It is generally believed to be the primary force that transformed the once overwhelmingly Democratic South into a reliable GOP stronghold in presidential elections.\"\" The cool thing is, I only need 1 source that speaks to the view being the most widely or generally held, and here I have 4-5 source. I say 4-5 because one of the sources actually identifies the suburban viewpoint as a minority/dissenting viewpoint instead of articulating the majority viewpoint, but they are both different sides of the same coin as far as this discussion is concerned. And what's even cooler is that any single one of these sources takes precedence in establishing a viewpoint's weight on WP over your OR argument of your observed google citations. Again, I'm going to direct you to WP:TEND because demanding others to come up with sources to disprove your unsourced claim is an example of tendentious editing. It says \"\"or you challenge them to find a source that disproves your unsourced claim.\"\" FYI, your unsourced claim is that the suburban strategy and the generally held viewpoint of the Southern strategy have \"\"equal\"\" support in scholarship. Not only is this claim of yours unsourced, but it's also already been debunked by any of the authors I've just listed in this comment and previous comments, yet you still refuse to accept it.  \n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "A.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.\n",
      "\n",
      "          \n",
      "\n",
      "So it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam\n",
      "\n",
      "        \n",
      "\n",
      "Also Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, \"\"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time.\"\" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "A.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.\n",

      "A.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam.

[9] At the time, most colonists were indentured servants from the British Isles. Beginning in the early 17th century, colonists imported African indentured servants and slaves. In the early period, the working classes of indentured servants, slaves and free workers lived and worked closely together, leading to marriages and unions.[4] The historian Ira Berlin has described the first generation of African-descended people in Virginia as the \"\"charter generation.\"\" He has noted that some were the multiracial descendants (usually men), who were the children of Portuguese and Spanish men active in the slave trade, and African women in the slave ports. Some of the men arrived as free laborers, having accompanied Europeans. Others were imported as slaves.[10]\"\"\n",

Unless someone can find a slave record for Melungeons then it should be removed and anything pertaining to slaves.

      "We want this Wikipedia page to be as accurate as possible right? Compare the two images.(The milage is in the upper right courner). Stopping at 20 miles takes you into downtown Kansas City. Stopping at 15 miles you don't even make it into Missouri, you barely make it across the Johnson County border with Wyandotte County. I'd be ok with a 15-20 mile statement, but my hang-up is you are still in Kansas Dorothy. Kansas City's Downtown is not 5 miles wide, so a more accurate range is needed. Maybe try 18-21 miles, cuz at 18 you've at least crossed the border. Yes, you can be in Kansas City at 15 miles, but you are not downtown, in fact MNU is only about 8 miles from the south part of Kansas City (take 135st/HWY150), but that is not downtown (and even further from the Kansas City International Airport). And I'm confused to why we will use the image from the institutional website claiming to the be most reliable, but yet third party site milage site is more reliable than the institutional website milage? Would not the institutional website be reliable for both? As far as 19 and 20 go... 19 is an exact measurement, and the word about was to suppose to give some leeway, as to make it an approximate of 20 (a nice even number) miles.

My English is relatively bad, so I won’t do it myself. But here are some important issues:\n",
      "The militarism the article talks about as implemented by the emperor was a social phenomenon, about which later (Weimar) politicians said, that it was one reason for WW I. Because of this all Germans were guilty for forcing the war and had to accept their responsibility. In the article it looks like the population didn’t support the militarism. It was just the other war around. Bismarck’s policy of a “satuierter Staat” (satisfied Country) was not  strongly supported by the Germans.\n",

      "Also Wilhelm II’s fleet policy should be mentioned. The german fleet was heavily expanded, which made the British Empire look at Germany anxiously. “Politik der freien Hand”)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Also a link to the Fashoda-crisis and its solution and the Entente Cordiale or the Triple Entente should be amended, as they were referred as a surrounding of Germany by enemies (“Umringt von Feinden”).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another matter is, that it is not clear whether Bismarck himself would have been able to keep up his system of treaties for a longer period of time, because of it’s complexity. Some historians believe, that this system had to lead to a new European war, it only was the question, when.\n",

      "You have now cited only one source (albeit only in the edit summary)  The New York Times. Apparently, however, you are unaware of the close personal relationship between Lindbergh and the author of that paper's stories, Times' aviation writer Lauren \"\"Deac\"\" Lyman, which went back to 1927 when Lyman befriended a then unknown Lindbergh. Lyman was the only member of the press whom Lindbergh told about his decision to go into self exile in Europe, and he did so because he knew that Lyman would paint this actions in terms most favorable to his friend and, with Lindbergh deliberately \"\"unavailable at sea\"\" for more than a week, that this \"\"spin\"\" would initially be repeated by other papers that would pick up the NYT story from that paper's news service. This relationship and the tone of the resulting early accounts based on are addressed in detail in the cited TIME Magazine article on the issue of press coverage published on January 6th. (\"\"Since Colonel Lindbergh had offered no public explanation of his departure, and radiograms sent to him on the American Importer were returned with the notation \"\"Addressee not aboard,\"\" the Times' story remained the scripture on which the week's exegesis was built. It was written by bespectacled Lauren D. (\"\"Deac\"\") Lyman, who as the Times' aviation editor befriended obscure young Aviator Lindbergh before his flight to Paris in 1927. Throughout the week Reporter Lyman stoutly refused to reveal the source of his scoop. But Colonel Lindbergh's hatred of certain sensational newspapers, and his corresponding affection for the courteous Times, have long been well-known. ... In keeping with the Times' policy of protecting Hero Lindbergh's privacy, Reporter Lyman weakened his otherwise first-rate scoop by failing to disclose the time and place of the Lindberghs' sailing, their ship's name, their exact destination.\"\") As Lindbergh's real intentions became known  his intention to live in exile in Europe  it then became clear that this was not just a vacation abroad but that Lindbergh had \"\"fled\"\" the country to protect them from danger that he felt that he and his family were being exposed to in the United States and that he would be living in Europe indefinitely.\n",

      "Hello, you recently declined my request for this permission, which I completely respect. You listed my mishap with WilyD as the main reason for this, stating that I did several things wrong which I get. The misunderstanding was based on a believed piece of policy in my head which was that editors do not generally remove CSD tags (especially when they had been tagged by an admin) but clicked on the \"\"contest this speedy deletion\"\" button. Now I admit fully I was wrong, and don't know where I even got the initial conception from. I then added the template to Wily's user page (and as you mentioned I changed the default text). You said that I did not consider the possibility that I was mistaken, when I did (why else would I have asked another experienced editor for advice?) and then promptly realised my mistake and set about fixing the problem. I do believe that this was an isolated incident, based on a single misconception in my mind that led to one or two other non-brilliant outcomes. However, I would ask that you reconsider your decline, especially as I made a good number of reverts over the last day or so, and I believe that I am getting it right a good deal more often than not. I understand if you decline, as it was not an attractive mistake to make, but I do ask that you reconsider, as I believe that it was more or less a one-off with no other related incidents in the near past (that I can see).

      "     Granted, it's very hard nowadays to be sheltered from swearing and cursing, but I'm relieved that in my curiosity I found that the percentage of those with TS who exhibited this is considerably less than half.

Does the part of his mind that says not to say it then turn off, or what?\n",

Second, Paul Siebert, assuming what Alex told me is true, is a Holocaust denier, as he denied acts of genocide committed against Holocaust victims at the end of the war.  This can be confirmed in Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State and The Fall of Berlin 1945, both of which have been cited here by Alex.\n",

      " It is interesting how the perception of COI across different subjects. I recall a while back a (serious) proposal was put in place suggestion on Irish people should have a voice in determining the name of the article of their state. Meanwhile, a (very experienced) editor tried to argue the scientists should not be permitted to edit animal testing because they have a COI (in as much they have an interest in the subject because it keeps them in jobs). Aspergers is a particularly interesting situation, because some of the characteristics of the syndrome could mimic the symptoms of COI editing (i.e. an abnormally intense focus on the Asperger article). It could be quite a tricky situation to deal with, actually. et \"\n",

That type of discourse is normally reserved for the talk pages with the article itself reserved for consensus information on the topic. Evidently there is a lack of consensus on the use of call centers in the insurance business and a need for further discussion.

Maybe a page on the unique geographical or cultural/historical happenings on the southern part of the Korean peninsula would be accurately named, but there doesn't seem to be a good reason not to redirect to Republic of Korea. China, for instance, isn't the page name for the People's Republic of China. There are plenty of other counter examples, of course, Japan being the name of the page for the State of Japan, or Zimbabwe for the Republic of Zimbabwe, or a dozen others, but these names are so close to their formal names as to only designate the form of government. Because of the DPRK and ROK's mutual use of the term 'Korea', this isn't a satisfactory alternative. \"\"South Korea\"\" reads increasingly anarchronistic, a vestigal designation from the Korean war when the difference between the two countries was most importantly location-geographic in the sense of military holdings, and a division which was supposed to be temporary.

      "\"\"On DeVirga's map, the northwestern continent is called \"\"Norveca.\"\"  This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called \"\"Regnii Norwegie\"\" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region \"\"Septentrio;\"\" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows \"\"Terra Nova\"\" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The \"\"North Pole\"\" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or \"\"New Land.\"\"  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as \"\"Markland\"\"which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles \"\"the Icelands.\"\"  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called \"\"Ibernia\"\" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The \"\"new\"\" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as \"\"Gronlandia Provincia.\"\"  Thus, the name \"\"Norveca\"\" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...\"\"  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   \n",

You are basically telling everyone here not to trust the CIA, BBC, United Nations' 2006 chart that is posted above, which is also posted at BBC, and that everyone should trust your 1980 map which was made by an unknown person. First of all, I am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are. I never changed the numbers, rather I changed and replaced the old 1980, hard to read and understand map of yours. My map, the one above, explains little more about each Ethnic group, while yours does not. Demographics of Afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from. By watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in Afghanistan's article, there must be something you are up to. Also something I noticed, you keep talking about the numbers of Pashtuns should be lower, which indicates that you wish to see them die or something. I will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon. I wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as I find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with. You keep reminding that Pashtuns killed this Pashtuns killed that, why don't you discuss about Pashtuns always being killed by invaders. They have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country. This law is practiced in all the countries of the world. By now I've already realized that you are not just a traitor to Afghanistan but also a true enemy of Pashtuns. I have Allah (Almighty God) on my side and that's why I always win.\n",

In addition, there were an estimated 5000 deaths a year from illegal abortion. This concept helped put reproduction and the woman’s body back into the hands of the woman in a safe way. I also feel as though some of the language used in this article has a negative connotation. For example, when it is stated that she “promoted a procedure called menstrual extraction... if she were pregnant, this would constitute a non-professional abortion.” it sounds as if the article is trying to claim that she promoted abortions, which isn’t necessarily true. What she did promote was women reclaiming their bodies and taking them out of the hands of the male-dominated medical world and into their own. She PROVIDED women with means to learn about their bodies at a time where birth control did not exist. I also think it should be noted that after Roe v. Wade, she traveled to Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico, to name a few, and attended national and international conferences as advocates of women’s health rights. In addition, I think it should be specified what the Roe v. Wade decision entailed, and how it made abortion legalized so she was therefore able to establish the women-run clinics. Roe v. Wade has a Wikipedia article and can be linked. \n",

Mentioning the context of the women’s health movement and how she was providing women with the means to take control of their fertility and reproduction when they had no other means to do so and could even face legal persecutions if they did. By adding this, the article will make more sense, especially because it mentions her arrest and things like the Roe v. Wade trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "From an ES/WGS perspective, the revolutionary time where woman began to take back the control of their bodies. There are many misconceptions around things like abortion even still today. Woman have been criminalized for performing or having abortions in history and even today. And I think it is important to take note of that. Also, Carol Downer has played such a crucial role in Women’s Health and Feminist activism, I was surprised at how short her article was. I also think that The Women’s Health Movement should have it’s own article on Wikipedia (currently there is “Feminist health centers” and “Women’s Health” and “Feminist Movement”)\n",

I am also wondering if you have some special knowledge, perhaps based in some study of philosophy of language or metaphysics, or if this is your general impression? I'm in a pretty embarrassing spot here, as pretty clearly any term is also a concept (this is not intended to count for physical objects which can also be \"\"thought of\"\"). The only question is about organizing the subject matter according to some ontology that makes sense. There are many \"\"terminology\"\" categories, and I basically see them as \"\"junk\"\" categories where articles that are hard to classify end up. I can't be everywhere, but in the areas I take care of, I dutifully remove articles from \"\"terminology\"\" categories and place them in the appropriate subcategory of \"\"concepts\"\".

As I believe you know, Vandalism is \"\"Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia.\"\" (emph. in orig.) In fact, \"\"test\"\" edits are not considered vandalism - vandalistic edits require that one be acting in bad faith - specifically \"\"adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated.\"\" PM is not permitted to remove or restate such, as he is not permitted to edit articles about living individuals. Additionally, if PM intended to alledge he was \"\"removing vandalism,\"\" there are a series of steps he should have taken after removing said vandalism - he did not warn the user, and he did not mark the edit as minor. In summary, said edit, however rightful it was, however justified it was under WP:BLP, and all else, was expressly prohibited by PM's probation. If he would like to apply for a modification to that probation allowing him to make good edits to living persons biography, I would have no comments on that application, but untill such time, he is not permitted to edit biographies of living people.   \n",

Regarding a “fav” or famous fossil list, I think it would become intractably long, not to mention the subjectivity involved. I’ve already noticed that the Lagerstätte page has fallen victim to subjectivity, as several listed sites are not traditionally considered to meet the admittedly fuzzy criteria (i.e., extraordinary fossil richness or completeness); 100 paleontologists would generate 100 different lists.

Online newspapers from places with relatively weak internet access and less developed internet/GNU/linux communities (e.g. Iraq!) probably might be volatile in the sense that after a few years they will change software/hosting/URLs or go offline for whatever reason. Another point is that webcitation.org probably doesn't (yet) have a long term reputation. archive.org and arxiv.org have been around for a long time, arxiv.org has very solid institutional backing and a huge amount of mirroring.

      "Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was 10th President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He was a lawyer, member of the Philippine House of Representatives (1949–1959) and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959–1965). He was Senate President in 1963. He claimed to have led a guerrilla force called Ang Maharlika in northern Luzon during the Second World War, something much doubted however to be true.[1][2] As Philippine president and strongman, his greatest achievement was in the fields of infrastructure development and international diplomacy. However, his administration was marred by massive authoritarian corruption, despotism, nepotism, political repression, and human rights violations. He benefited from a large personality cult in the Philippines during his regime.[3] In 1983, his government was implicated in the assassination of his primary political opponent, Benigno Aquino, Jr.. The implication caused a chain of events, including a tainted presidential election that served as the catalyst for the People Power Revolution in February 1986 that led to his removal from power and eventual exile in Hawaii. It was later alleged that he and his wife Imelda Marcos had moved billions of dollars of embezzled public funds to the United States, Switzerland, and other countries, as well as into alleged corporations during his 20 years in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was born September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte outside Laoag City to parents Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin. He was named after Ferdinand VII of Spain and baptized into the Philippine Independent Church. According to the Marcos family's oral history, the family name was originally Taguktok, and their Ilokano roots have some Japanese and Chinese ancestry. Ferdinand was a champion debater at the University of the Philippines, where he also participated in boxing, swimming and wrestling.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 1938, Mariano Marcos, his brother Pio, his son Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo were prosecuted for the murder of Julio Nalundasan. On September 20, 1935, the day after Nalundasan (for the second time) defeated Mariano Marcos for the National Assembly seat for Ilocos Norte, Nalundasan was shot and killed in his house in Batac. According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan, with Ferdinand Marcos eventually doing the killing. In late January 1939, they were denied bail [4] and in the fall[when?] of 1939 they were convicted. Ferdinand and Lizardo received the death penalty for premeditated murder, while Mariano and Pio were found guilty only of contempt of court. The Marcos family took their appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which on October 22, 1940, overturned the lower court's decision and acquitted them of all charges but contempt.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1939, while incarcerated, Ferdinand Marcos graduated cum laude with a law degree from the U.P. College of Law. If he had not been put in jail for twenty seven days, he would have graduated magna cum laude. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society. While in detention, Governor Roque B. Ablan Sr. of Ilocos Norte helped Marcos study for the bar exams by providing a desk lamp in his cell, law books and reviewers. Marcos passed the bar examination with an almost perfect score of 98.01%, while also writing an 830-page defense. Several people contested his score and a retake was taken albeit an oral bar examination witnessed by several people. His second bar examination resulted in a 100% score, the highest grade obtained in the Philippine Bar).[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcos became senator after serving as member of the House of Representatives for three terms. In the Senate he served as minority floor leader before gaining the Senate presidency. He established a record for having introduced a number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the republic's statute books.[7]\n",

You're right that the total energy is much higher in the rest frame of one of the protons, but it's the center-of-momentum energy that matters, because the cheapest way to make new particles is at relative rest. By the way, you can calculate your result much more easily by using the fact that the dot product of four-vectors is frame invariant: (7 TeV, 7 TeV) · (7 TeV, -7 TeV) = (mp, 0) · (E, E), so E = 49 TeV2 / mp ≈ 52,000 TeV.

      "First, I would observe that there was a nearly unanimous consensus in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winzapper to retain the article.  Every established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article.  Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as \"\"keep\"\" regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominator supported deletion, unless the article constituted a serious WP:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity.  Why?  Simply put, the strengths of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute.  Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluating them.  So, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweighed nearly all others.  An administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here.  This is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not.  Rather, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominator for the deletion of an article.  Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletion to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasive; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletion of an article before deleting it (though the supporters of deletion may be distinctly in the minority).\n",
      "\n",
      "As a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be deleted.  While it is true that Wikipedia's verifiability and notability policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of notability, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its notability, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be deleted.  Rather, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish notability are likely to exist, the  community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD.  So, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletion on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and failure to establish notability, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren't produced during the AFD discussion.  Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion.  Consequently, arguments of the form \"\"keep, I believe this subject is notable\"\" are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.  \"\n",

That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your \"\"proof\"\" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own \"\"proof\"\" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154  \n",

This is speculative at best (and perhaps too optimistic, again, according to 2005 election results). Also, Michel Aoun's knowledge of Italian and Spanish is paltry at best, so that should be put into question as well. In addition, no mention of Aoun's \"\"poor parents\"\" has ever been made, unless you assume that having a butcher for a father is an unquestionable characteristic of poverty and low-class. Also, as reference to his tenure as prime minister from 1988 to 1990, I propose adding an \"\"acting\"\" in parentheses after the prime minister title, as the Lebanese Constitution briefs that only a Sunni Muslim may hold that position (or we should precise that his tenure was an exception or an anomaly, once again for the reason listed earlier).\"\n",

If the guy gives lectures in New York synagogues and knocks down his country every single minute, using every opportunity in such influential newspapers as New York Post, then one can state that his interests are not only personal. You can not find any intellectual person among neoconservatives in New York Post. Michelle Malkin, Andrea Peyser, Deborah Orin (may her rest in peace, although I know she is rotting in hell)and other essayists are the ones who make a great company for Amir Taheri. This guy has no mind at all. I agree that Iran's regime is wrong, but the regime of Shah that Amir Taheri is longing for, because he owned Keyhan during that regime was not any better and Islamic Revolution was justified. Look at how they intriduce Amir Taheri in both this article and in New York Post. \"\"Based in Europe memeber of Benador Associates\"\". Is Europe that small? Is that a small town?

They make it clear to visiting editors that any interested parties have had a fair chance to improve the article, and hadn't, which is often a point used in support of deletion. Conversely, if the article isn't tagged, it's not clear that interested parties have been given a chance to improve the article, which may be used to support a keep argument. Removing the tag makes the status either way less clear. Yes, it's available in the history, but why make editors go through the extra work of checking the history? In addition, an AfD can end without reaching a consensus, which means the tag most likely still applies and would have to be restored. No, the time to remove the tag is after a consensus has been reached at the AfD that the subject does meet the notability guidelines, i.e. after it is closed with result keep (or in some cases, when the eventual outcome is clear per WP:SNOW).

And those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose of lifing the few exceptional people onto their shoulders. You and me, we're exceptional. However, these Wikipedians, the majority of them, are liberal. And they love to advance liberal/progressive causes, but also find some Republicans/conservatives amusing. But the one thing they love more than a conservative politican, is to see that conservative fail, fall, die trying. In spite of everything this conservative has done for them (such as Jesse Helms), eventually they will hate you. That is why I came to Wikipedia. I came not only to fix some factual errors prevalent in some Wikipedia articles; I also came to give a much more NPOV to articles involving conservatives, where oftentimes bias, and even some out-and-out factual distortions, are prevalent. Wikipedia's time has come for fixing. Like Constantinople or Rome before it, this place has become a breeding ground for suffering, bias, and injustice. It is for this reason, Bbb23, I'm asking you to unblock me. Yes, I will follow Wikipedia's rules to the letter if you do. As far as I'm aware, there's nothing in Wikipedia's rules against removing bias from articles. In fact, WP:NPOV encourages it. Think about it, Bbb23. I could accomplish a lot of good. Adios,\n",

      "\n",
      "CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  \n",
      "\n",
      "True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. \n",
      "\n",
      "The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. \n",
      "\n",
      "CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .\n",
      "\n",
      "My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.\n",

As far as I know, however, Plant said \"\"my mother was a gypsy\"\", where \"\"gypsy\"\" could've meant \"\"a traveller\"\" or a \"\"a hippie\"\" - in terms of a lifestyle, not ethnicity. He could've meant some Itinerant groups in Europe like for instance the Irish Travellers or maybe some Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups. I know Robert Plant is from the UK, and I've heard that British people usually don't use the word \"\"gypsy\"\" when speaking about Romani people, but they use it when speaking about people who lead itinerant life. Any conformation that Plant used it in terms of his Romani ethnic origin?   \"\n",

The Tenth Amendment, which states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. The legal encyclopedia American Jurisprudence says the following in regard to constitutionality: The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it; an unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed ...

In my interpretation, the early October version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrase's usage, and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre. More mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. The article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a \"\"conspiracy theory\"\" is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. Also, \"\"generally and \"\"commonly considered\"\" in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for NPOV.

      "A skyhook is a proposed space transportation concept that aims to reduce the cost of placing payloads into space. \n",
      "\n",
      "Skyhooks are often confused with an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator, but they are different.  A skyhook is much shorter than a space elevator and does not reach down to the surface of the Earth.  A skyhook requires a suborbital launch vehicle to get to the bottom end of the skyhook, a space elevator does not.  Due to the much shorter length of the skyhook and the resulting reduction in strain, skyhooks up to 4,000 km in length can be built with existing materials, while an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator cannot.Amanda S. Wu, Tsu-Wei Chou, \"\"Carbon Nanotube Fibers for Advanced Composites\"\", Materials Today, vol. 15, July–August 2012, pp. 302-310   \n",
      "\n",
      "The advantage of a skyhook it that the lower end of the cable is moving at less than orbital velocity for its altitude.  As a result, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the skyhook can carry a larger payload than it could going directly to orbit on its own.  When the cable is long enough, single stage to skyhook flight with a reusable launch vehicle such as a spaceplane becomes possible.  Reusability of the launch vehicle and an enlarged payload fraction makes for much lower launch costs.   Once the cable has become long enough the skyhook becomes cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator (assuming a space elevator can ever be built), and the skyhook can be built.{{cite jour\n",

      "There's already Liturgical year, which discusses the Proper of the Season, although it can be a bit confusing since it discusses Catholic and Protestant uses, which aren't always the same. Any article would have to include both the pre- and post-Vatican II calendars, most notably Septuagesima and Passiontide as well as Ordinary Time vs. Time after Epiphany/Pentecost. The only change I see would be to create a specific \"\"Roman Catholic Liturgical Year\"\" article. As for the 1962 Calendar of the Saints, I created the older one mainly because I already had the pre-1955 calendar in electronic format, it's more consistent with past use since Trent, and it includes feasts that were later dropped. I think the same article can be used for both the 1955 and 1962 calendars, adding the rank of feasts (Double/III Class), and some sort of special formatting or asterisks for Feasts which are only on one or the other.  \n",
      "Re-reading the first comment, I'm also starting to like the idea. We can have one article on the year in general, what effect it has on the liturgy, and the arrangement of the liturgical books, with sections or sub-articles on the Proper of the Season and the Proper of the Saints, both articles discussing the 1955/1962 and 1970 versions.  \"\n",

      "So a third pornography industry advocate has joined this correspondence, which increases the number of participants but actually decreases its importance in my affairs, as well as the relevance of Wikipedia in important matters regarding the health of our society (it is lamentably our society... I only wish I could call it your society).  But I may call Wikipedia your propaganda tool, since you are apparently the one who has been granted authority to tolerate certain comments which you interpret as being unbiased and to crassly delete other information which you interpret as being biased.  If you really want to avoid bias, just casually investigate the history of your pornography supporting friend Horrorshow, who, not surprisingly, has been busy editing other articles that clearly promote the pornography industry.  Wikipedia: a free speech tool for the people or a propaganda tool for a certain sector of the population which seeks to control people's opinions on matters that adversely affect their mental health?  Quite a question to ponder.  But my point on bias is that every author is biased.  Just because Wikipedia can be edited by supposedly anybody (in theory it can be, but in reality it is clearly controlled by certain well-organized individuals who have made Wikipediaing their vocations), does not make Wikipedia an unbiased source of information.  The author of this webpage, who clearly has an interest in displaying information that promotes the pornography industry in the United States, is biased.  His or her comments on Lubben's religious views clearly betray that sentiment, as do the history of his or her activities on Wikipedia.  And you don't need to tolerate anything from me any longer, because I will stop now... or maybe I won't, I guess it depends on just how much time I'm willing to waste communicating with you.  This is becoming Dostoevskian, Underground Man... give it a read sometime... it might help you.Veritas, Semper .  But you and I both know where the truth lies in this matter.  There is no need for an arbitrator, who, again, would be mistakenly be labeled an unbiased third party.\n",

Given that he has not showed up on set for 3 months and is not mentioned in any press releases, even though he is not commited to any movie right now, his involvment is at least questionable and far from certain.

Miroslav Radman, a Croat, is a member of the French Academy of Sciences, does that make him French? I also do not want to start a \"\"nationalist\"\" argument with you so let us stay focused on facts. I will not revert the article until we sort things out. I agree with you that Andric was both a Croatian and a Serbian writer, but the issue here is his ethnicity because the article is about the Serbian nation. If you would write a novel in German, that would make you a German writer, but not a German by ethnicity (even if you would be a German nationalist). You can not choose your ethnicity just like you can not choose your race, it is something you are born with.

Actually, Wichita has a larger MSA in the state of Kansas than Kansas City would even if you counted the numbers. JoCo adds about 500 thousand and the dotte is about 100 thousand. According to the article on Wichita, there are 680,000 in their metro.

      "First, I'd like to thank you for discussing this issue with me.  You could just have told me to take a hike or something.  Anyway, let's take a look at Image:Esquire Jennifer Connelly 1991 8.jpg, the Jennifer Connelly picture that I tagged today.  The image was moved to the infobox this morning which means that it was not being used according to the license.  It was instead being used specifically to depict Connelly, not in context of discussing that particular issue of the magazine.  That's why I tagged that image.  With the image moved back to the paragraph concerning the issue of the magazine, a compelling argument could be made that the image is now being used in accord with the license.  This seems to be the consensus of the people on the discussion page as well, though the discussion just started.  So, whether or not this image is fair-use depends on how it is used in the article.  I am much happier if this is spelled out in a rationale on the image page.  That the license specifically states that a detailed fair-use rationale should be added seems, to me, to support this contention.  In this case, the rationale would be simple, something along the lines of, \"\"used to depict issue of magazine in question in paragraph which discusses this issue, not solely to depict Connelly.\"\"  Now, I previously mentioned that the image description page specifically mentions that the dvdcover requires a detailed rationale.  In many cases, the fair-use case is obvious.  It's a DVD cover used to illustrate the particular DVD in question.  But the image description page and the license text both still indicate that the rationale is required.  Also, what often ends up happening is that the DVD image then gets used to depict something outside of the license.  A DVD of a movie starring Connelly, for example, used solely to illustrate what Connelly looks like.\n",
      "Now, I've been using the fair-use-disputed tag for quite some time but recently, people have been correcting that to the missing-rationale tag, so I just started using that.  This has the added advantage of requiring that the issue be resolved in short order and providing a simple copy-and-paste official warning template which can be used (and is specifically designed) to warn the person who uploaded the image.\n",
      "I am concerned that a great number of images on Wikipedia are used in blatant violation of copyright.  This is clear and I doubt anyone would debate it.  As a result, I personally do request that people who upload copyrighted images provide an accurate source, an accurate license, and a detailed fair-use rationale.  In all honesty, I'm quite happy with any reasonable attempt at a fair-use rationale and accept many that I believe fall far short of what Wikipedia officially requests.  I believe it is important to deal with images without sufficient information because continuing to accept images which may violate copyright put us at direct risk.  It may be obvious to the uploader why an image is fair-use but we may not be able to contact the uploader when we are sued.  And as I mentioned before, I believe both the license and image description help page specifically require this.\n",
      "Now that I have stated my point and you have stated your point, there's a very good chance that we aren't going to agree.  I'm happy to request additional help, perhaps from the admin noticeboard policies page, if you think this would be productive.   \n",

      "\n",
      "When I added a picture of Robespierre, a user removed it, and claimed that it was doubtful where Robespierre was a liberal and claims that the Reign of Terror was not liberal. First of all, I believe a strong argument can be made that demonstrates that Robespierre being a Jacobin upheld many classical liberal values - albeit in a contorted way like Stalin's sociopathic version of Marxism. In Robespierre: The Voice of Virtue, that seeks to describe Robespierre not merely as a tyrant but as a man with genuine beliefs, it describes Robespierre as being a proponent of universal suffrage, of being an abolitionist (seeking to end slavery). Robespierre was part of a revolution that was associated with many classical liberal goals. Robespierre's Reign of Terror against the Girondists and counter-revolutionaries (both real and suspected) that was pursued according to Robespierre to solidify the revolution. Historian Francois Furet claims the Reign of Terror was deeply ideologically rooted in the idea of promoting \"\"man's regeneration\"\" based on free will and enlightenment, that the Committee of Public Safety promoted that resulted in violence against people suspected of being counterrevolutionaries. The issue of Robespierre's association with liberalism - if he was a liberal or if he was not a liberal - needs to be investigated further here by other users, because regardless of Robespierre's controversies he was an important figure in the Jacobin movement and the French Revolution.  \"\n",

If you attempt to replace it, figuring it was a vandal (troll elsewhere) and your edit was correct, you get a nasty warning on your user talk page saying roughly \"\"you can't do that and you will get your butt kicked if you do it again\"\". If you persist in editing a few dozen other times, eventually somebody will tell you about BRD, so you try it. You go to the talk page and post your opinion only to be told by some of the same bully team \"\"opinions don't matter here\"\", followed by more cold warnings about being a vandal or other policy, du jour. Next time one attempts to edit and supplies sources for statements by professional people only to be reverted with \"\"not a notable source\"\" or \"\"we don't use primary sources to contradict secondary sources\"\". If you attempt to complaint you get another editor giving you a ban on your talk page and telling you you violated one of the 4,567 WP rules.

I laid a complaint against one of this bully team and all I got was WP:Boomerang threats and WP:Stale and WP:BLP warnings from the offending bully, I complained about. I feel I am still suffereing from that as I get regularly visited by one of the same bully team, who hacks up my user page until I complain and then I get banned for WP:BLP or WP:3RR because they coud detect I was thinking about reverting one more time. Another good one is \"\"lack of collaboration\"\" on my own user talk page.  My conclusion is that this bully team exist to attack IP editors on a fear and predjudice basis. This seems to be the usual psychology, on the Internet in forums and real life, unfortunately. People fear the newbie and the unknown, attacking to rid themselves the unknown.  Most of the protection mechanisms are not available to IP editrs and are unknown. The more I educate myself on the ways of WP the more I realize they ren't not applied to IPs equally. I have been ridiculed so many times here I have toignore most of it, now. /rant off LOL 99.251.114.120  \n",

      "Reviewing your sources.... \"\"MSM in Africa\"\" does not contain the string \"\"trans\"\" anywhere in the document.  I don't know what you expect in that document being used as a reference, except to increase your refcount.  UNAIDS states that \"\"TG is typically considered alongside\"\".  It is fairly equivocal about the whole matter.  The Powerpoint Document gives the most convincing argument with the statement: \"\"With regard to HIV surveillance and prevention, the CDC’s current practice is not to separate MTF TG and TS people from the MSM category, with no attention paid to the risks of FTM TG people.\"\" (A noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay.)  The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as \"\"MSM\"\" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as \"\"MSTGW\"\" and not \"\"MSM\"\" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: \"\"Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as \"\"balls.\"\" These social networks include \"\"houses\"\" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000). All four also were commercial sex workers.\"\"  This is clear information pointing to that these individuals were drag queens.\n",
      "My conclusion... I have to admit, I've been viewing TG too narrowly, and excluding individuals that are TG, yet also MSM.  However, that doesn't mean that TS individuals are MSM... it's hard to argue that a drag queen isn't MSM, while it is hard to argue that a post-operative MTF living a life in stealth is an MSM.

I found out through him sending me an image of the official website. Since it was only an image, I checked the website just in case and was shocked to find out that that was indeed the order that they had on there. I did not and still do not have any proof that the mobile version of the website is \"\"outdated\"\" as he stated. When I made the edits (prior to my knowledge of mobile being different from the official website) I chose to not change or add a reference because When I clicked on the already present website reference, it automatically took me to the mobile version, being that I was using my mobile device to make the edits. Due to prior research of the fighters involved in the first three bouts and common knowledge of the sport, all common sense and logic led to me believing (like I always did) that the order of the bouts on the mobile version was the correct one. As soon as I found out the mobile version and official version were different I re-edited the page to rearrange the bouts to the most logical order and changed the prior reference from the official site to the mobile. I was never aware that you guys didn't accept mobile versions of websites with more logical information as references until I read his complaint and your response.

Since these secondary sources are reviews of data then bias is not only unlikely, but virtually impossible. So, if anything, we can say none of the sources are hostile toward the Watchtower organization or to the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Hence I fail to see veracity in your complaint. \n",

      "I recommend that you consider the sub-heading “Acceptance within Jehovah’s Witness community” within the article about Jehovah’s Witnesses and blood transfusion. If you dispute its content and sources then please specify exactly why. Also, please keep in mind that due to 1) the Watchtower organization’s policy to have JWs shun JWs who conscientiously accept transfusion of blood products it forbids, and 2) your reputation as an ardent supporter of Watchtower policies, then it is expected that JWs who disagree with the Watchtower’s blood doctrine would not you access to their choices, and HIPPA regulations are a powerful incentive for clinicians to keep patient preference highly confidential, particularly when it is specifically requested. Hence your personal experience is likely of little if any value in addressing the issue of your complaint.\n",

The problem, Nova, is that you think somehow that I was just birthed on WP from a cabbage truck, and no next to nothing about policy and options.    I don't always use \"\"Show preview\"\", but I have used that option almost 50% of the time on articles.  I never even wanted to be an editor on WP, it happened ACCIDENTALLY.....because all the 4 articles (not many) that I created on WP were articles I thought would be there already.    And I was surprised they weren't.   So I felt compelled to create them.   Also, you notice that the number of articles I have edited on WP is only about 200 not even.      Cuz again, I'm more into QUALITY THAN QUANTITY.    And like everyone else on WP sometimes a person gets caught up.  If I WANTED to be a big shot on WP, with many created articles, and thousands of edited articles, I could....but I DO NOT WANT TO.       I don't really care that much.      But anyway, the point about \"\"Show preview\"\" I do use, and quite a bit....

      "Lloyd was born in Burchard, Nebraska, to James Darsie Lloyd (1865–1947) and Elizabeth Fraser (1869–1941); Harold's paternal great-grandparents were all from Wales. Young Harold was named for his paternal grandfather. Harold had an older brother, Gaylord (1888-1943), five years his senior. Like his younger brother, Gaylord acted in motion pictures, but his career was nowhere near as renowned as Harold's. Among other roles, he acted in 1921's \"\"Disraeli\"\" starring the famous George Arliss.  With Harold's help, there were even efforts to turn him into a comedy star.  He eventually went on to become a film executive.  When Harold was a child, his parents divorced and Lloyd chose to stay with his father.  Despite this, he and his brother always remained close to their mother.  Harold's father was always dreaming up grand get-rich-quick schemes that ended in disasters. They eventually ended up in Omaha where Lloyd had his first acting experience in a local stock company. He attended East High School and San Diego High School and received his stage training at the School of Dramatic Art (San Diego). In 1912, his father J. Darsie \"\"Foxy\"\" Lloyd was awarded the then-massive sum of $6,000 in a personal injury judgment (although this was split evenly between Lloyd and his lawyer) after being run over by an Omaha beer truck. Reportedly, on the toss of a coin (\"\"Heads is New York or Nashville or where I decide!, tails is San Diego\"\"), he and Lloyd moved west.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd had acted in various Vaudeville acts in theaters since boyhood, and started acting in one-reel film comedies shortly after moving to California. He soon began working with Thomas Edison's motion picture company, and eventually formed a partnership with fellow struggling actor and director Hal Roach, who had formed his own studio in 1913. The hard-working Lloyd became the most successful of Roach's comic actors between 1915 and 1919.\n",

      "I know W. Lloyd-Thomas and Clifford L.B. Hubbard did some of the older research on the corgi breeds (1930s).  W. Lloyd-Thomas mentioned the Teckel connection (he called it \"\"Tekal\"\") and dated the breed's orgin to around 1200 BC in papers he wrote (some of which I've read).  As is typical in writings of that era, his history is flowery and wordy and doesn't give specifics about the research.  He does say that mid-Cardiganshire is \"\"particularly wealthy in the remains of early Celtic fortifications (source: \"\"What the Modern Corgi Owes to its Cardigan Ancestors,\"\" AKC Gazette, October 1935),\"\" and I can only guess that it's from these remains that the corgi has been dated.  Incidently, it might be better to call the early corgi a \"\"livestock dog\"\" rather than a \"\"herding dog,\"\" as it was more of a guard...not unlike the Rottweiler.  I'm curious what the reason for the doubt is, though...does the corgi just seem recent?  I see no particular reason for skepticism...Celts have been around for a long time.  \"\n",

When you say \"\"the supposed spirit of the \"\"new Northern Ireland\"\" you seem to be essentially claiming that the new Northern Ireland is more a part of the Republic of Ireland than in was before. The reality is that NI is now less part of the UK, and less part of the ROI. As I write, the episode of 'Coast' on Northern Ireland is on TV, and it is just reminding me of how the NI article is Wikipedia's most shamefully negligent article: something I proved with examples over a year ago. It is bereft of locality and positivity. The more recent generations in NI expect a country to grow up in, not an abstract story, or a 'nowhere place' - they have one in every needed sense, except the minds of those who need to put their on need and idea of nationalism first.   \n",

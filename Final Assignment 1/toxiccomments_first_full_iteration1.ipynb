      "lord Shiva for Featured article \n",
      "I just see many important features relating to the topic was missing, including a small description and link to Maha Shivaratri .       I would like to give my points here.Undoubtedly lord Shiva is linked to all sections and regions of the Indian society.There are great works relating to lord Shiva in many languages. Remember he is pre vedic god, immensely popular among tribes later on included in the Vedas. If the page depicts what is in popular culture it will be a great source and the page should become \"\"Featured Article\"\".

The Wikipedia Ambassador Program is currently looking for Campus Ambassadors to help with Wikipedia assignments at another Houston school, which will be participating in the Public Policy Initiative for the Spring 2011 semester.  The role of Campus Ambassadors will be to provide face-to-face training and support for students on Wikipedia-related skills (how to edit articles, how to add references, etc.). This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.\n",

      " On April 21, 1659, after a morning prayer, Trubetskoy ordered an all-out assault on the fortress's fortifications. The city was shelled, a few incendiary bombs were dropped inside, and the huge army moved on to capture the city. At one point the troops of Trubetskoy even broke inside the city walls, but were thrown back by the fierce resistance of the Cossacks inside. After the fiasco of the initial assault, Trubetskoy abandoned his plans of a quick assault and proceeded to shell the city and to fill the moat with earth. The Cossacks stubbornly held on in spite of all the fire unleashed on the city: during the night the earth put to fill in the moat was used to strengthen the city walls, and the besieged even undertook several daring counterattacks on Trubetskoy's besieging army. These attacks forced Prince Trubetskoy to move his military camp 10 km away from the city and thereby split his forces between the main army at his HQ and the army besieging Konotop. It is estimated that in the siege alone the Trubetskoy forces suffered casualties up to 10,000 men.[4] Instead of a quick campaign the siege dragged on for 70 days and gave Vyhovsky the much-needed time to prepare for the battle with the Russian army. Please clean away this exaggerated and long tale about nothing. You must add information, that Trubetskoy negotiated with Gulyanitski and finally had to put siege. Gulyanitski just wanted to win time. You must give time schedule, dates of the events and clean away this heroisation of some coronel.\n",

Never again was the tsar of Moscow able to master an army that strong. In mourning clothes showed himself Alexei Mikhailovich to the people and the terror seized Moscow. The blow was so hard because it was unexpected, and it followed such illustrious successes! It was only recently that Dolgoruki brought to Moscow a captured Lithuanian hetman, only recently was everyone talking about successes of Khovansky — and now Trubetskoy, for whom everyone had hopes higher than for others, and who was \"\"a man devout and graceful, in military affairs skilled and a fright for a foe\"\" — has ruined such a huge army! After capture of so many towns, after capture of the Lithuanian capital the royal city trembled for its own security: in August by tsar's decree people of all ranks hurried to build fortifications around Moscow. Often the tsar and the boyars were present themselves during the construction; people from outlying areas, their families with meagre belongings filled Moscow, and a rumour spread that the tsar was leaving to beyond the Volga and Yaroslavl[1].

      "\n",
      "If anybody knows why Claret is also called Bordeaux and is so popular in England, then perhaps we should include Basques (e.g. Piers Gaveston).  Basques entered English society at the same historic time as the Irish.  I also find it odd that Normans should get monolithic mention, without Brittany.  The Duchy of Brittany was a feudal subdomain of English Kings from the Norman Conquest until the 16th Century, in one capacity or another.  Aside from that, we all know the British (Welsh) connection that practically makes them who they are by definition.  Saint-Pierre and Miquelon has a flag and coat of arms which match English ethnic cousins on the Continent, because virtually all of New France was founded by those \"\"Frenchmen\"\" once under English yoke (north and west coasts of \"\"France\"\").  England's arms supposedly include Aquitaine and Gascony as well as the well-known Normandy.\n",

      "Normandy has best ethnic transferance with England.  Both Scandinavian.\n",
      "Brittany has best ethnic transferance with Wales.  Both Romano-Briton.\n",

      "\n",
      "All of these domains were of great post-Conquest importance, with added Scotland under Stuarts.  The union of the crowns under James (after the Tudor-Habsburg struggle) marked the divergence of a merely English people and it is from there, that a new British people was formed with participation in the Dutch and German dominions.  As far as I know and now think, the new \"\"British people\"\" is mostly a network of upper class/parliamentary aristocrats and their personal heritage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am proud to sport a 1/8th Aquitainian/Poitevin (although Huguenot) ancestor.  I don't know further genealogy to find a recent Parisian (non-London) French (what is called France, but has English character) ancestor.  You know what side this ancestor would have fought on if Buckingham's war with France got serious.  This opens up a window to the past glories of the Angevin Empire for me because although I sport a Scottish colonial American wife, my own specific heritage does not leave the bounds of the three leopards of the Plantagenet dominions.\n",
      "\n",
      "What some people should look at, is the French Wars of Religion maps.  Huguenots are numerous in Aquitaine/Gascony and Toulouse, both former Angevin areas.  One wonders if this Protestantism is an Albigensian Crusade relic, an Arian Visigothic vs Catholic Frankish relic or both combined with a culture of English resistance to the Capetians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if mentioning the Danes we shouldn't neglect the Norwegians.

As we've all seen even experienced editors hit the \"\"electric fence\"\" when the edits are coming in rapidly, my attitude has always been that a friendly reminder on this particular topic is never a bad thing, especially when, in some cases, the alternative is to let a tendentious editor goad someone into an accidental 3RR violation, and then WP:GAME the system with a WP:AN3 report to \"\"take out\"\" the other side. Also, my understanding of WP:3RR is that the rule applies per page, not per section of text. Also please bear in mind that one person's bias is another's NPOV - for example my add-back of the Attorney General language was made in good faith and is explained at Talk:Sarah Palin#Attorney General. You may well disagree with it and I may well turn out to be wrong, but as an editor with a couple thousand edits myself, and as someone who participates actively and regularly in talk page discussions, I would hope you would consider my edit proposals worthy of talk page discussion as opposed to a simple revert.

However, while it's obvious Weibel Elementary School has made a positive change on Irvington's test scores, Weibel Elementary School is only a small portion of Irvington's students. A much greater possibility is that students from other schools served as examples, and the inspiration was enough to raise Irvington's academic achievement. \n",

While the Weibel neighborhood benefited from the high tax revenues of other parts of mission san jose district, very little seperates the two area other than a larger working class population in the Irvington district as a result of the pre-silcon valley economies in which many autoworkers from Genreal Motors in Fremont, Peterbuilt, Trail Mobile, and Caterpillar in Newark,Ca, and Ford Motors in Milpitas,CA resided in the Irvington district.

So yes, we've appeared in publications, but what I understand Wikipedia is looking for is  third party and peer review.

Also, scope, I agree, is critical to what is posted and why...  And I see where my article needs to address our capabilities and educate.  Validating this approach, though, is complicated by conflict of interest and the availability of third-party resources and review.

      "Æµ§œš¹  You asked me to cite other inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article on Ebonics.  I direct your attention to the Wikipedia article on the “Oakland Ebonics Controversy”.  The Wikipedia article states:  “For students whose primary dialect was AAVE, the Oakland resolution mandated some instruction in that dialect, both for \"\"maintaining the legitimacy and richness of such language... and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills.\"\" This also included the proposed increase of salaries of those proficient in both AAVE and Standard English to the level of those teaching LEP (limited English proficiency) students and the use of public funding to help teachers learn AAVE themselves.[1]”      This not accurate.  In fact it is an outright lie.   In the first place, the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) \"\"Ebonics\"\", (2) \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" and/or (3) \"\"African Language Systems\"\".   As proof of this assertion I cite the fact it that the appellations African American Vernacular English does not appear anywhere in the entire OUSD resolution.  In fact the first four Whereas clauses of the OUSD resolution speak only to the existence of a linguistic continuity of the West Niger-Congo African language system in the language of African slave descendants and their unique language stature.   The very first whereas clause of the OUSD resolution states: WHEREAS, numerous validated studies demonstrate that African-American students as part of their culture and history as African people possess and utilize a language described in various scholarly approaches as “Ebonics” (literally Black sounds) or “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” or “African Language Systems.”  [For more information relative to the appellation “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” see Pan African Language In The Western Hemisphere (1973)]  The second Whereas clause of the resolution states: “Whereas, these studies have also demonstrated that African language systems have origins in West and Niger-Congo languages  and are not merely dialects of English”.   Now what more evidence does it take to prove that the OUSD resolution was not about African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution?\n",
      "Here is more.  A critical analysis will reveal that in its very essence the OUSD resolution was about the vindication of the equal protection of the law rights of the Afrocentric parents and their children under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  That is, the right of English Language Learners (ELL) of African ancestry to not be discriminated against on the basis of their language ancestry and provided instruction in the English language as a second language, i.e.,ESL.  In short, to be provided a Free and Appropriate Public Education.   As proof of this assertion I cite the fifth whereas clause of the OUSD Board's resolution which reads: \"\"Whereas, judicial cases in states other than California have recognized the unique language stature of African American pupils, and such recognition by courts has resulted in court-mandated educational programs which have substantially benefited African American children in the interest of vindicating their equal protection of the law rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the  United States Constitution.\"\"  (See OUSD resolution page 1. para. 5.)  As further evidence that the OUSD Board's resolution was about \"\"Ebonics\"\", \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" or \"\"African Language Systems\"\" and not African American Vernacular English, I cite the fact that first ‘Now Therefore Be It Resolved’ clause of the OUSD resolution states: “NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED the Board of Education officially recognizes the existence of, and cultural and linguistic bases of West and Niger -Congo African Languages Systems and these are the language patterns that many African American students bring to school;”  Clearly based on this passage of the resolution what the OUSD Board was addressing was the existence of  \"\"Ebonics\"\", \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" or \"\"African Language Systems\"\" and not African American Vernacular English.   The second “Therefore be it resolved” clause of the OUSD resolution states:  “BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Educ\n",

      "Anyway. It occurs to me that there must be thousands of photographers in the world, many-many much more competent than me, who would be willing to release their prized pictures to Wikipedia for free Wikipedia use only.  Much of the world is lacking in education and information. The world's poorest only hope in the short term is \"\"technology leap\"\" e.g. skipping the benefit of a free national press and going straight to the Internet with Wikipedia being a prime source of unbiased information. But not making pictures and information available from the professionals ensures that third world countries will only get second rate information, this will not help them. And on the contrary could be counterproductive to their development by holding back information.  Photographers often appear an arrogant breed, but deep down they are artists; caring people.  Perhaps Wikipedia should be calling on photographers around the world to make their contribution to the eradication of starvation and improved standards of living through education and Wikipedia. Hopefully this is not just soapbox but a constructive suggestion that can be the seed of something useful.  Des  \"\n",

On the other hand, I don't find Newt Gingrich or George Bush to be particularly compelling orators either. (Although Newt can be very interesting to listen to in smaller venues, particularly since he left office). And yet both had a high degree of political success - until Bush foundered when the Iraq war turned into a disaster. This goes back to my original point - the policy basis for both parties is more or less the same now as it has been since '92, because at their core the parties are have hardly changed. All that has been altered are details of communication and appeal. The idea that significant change is coming in either party has regularly proven to be untrue - losing elections has not seemed to presage major change. You could argue that Internet politicking has had a much more significant impact. Anyway, sorry I'm being somewhat unclear - in a rush, out the door!   T   \"\n",

While some reference to the previous work should be restored, I'd also argue for recasting the sentence to eliminate \"\"the December 1979 release date.\"\" The beginning of the very next paragraph states that the film was \"\"[r]eleased in North America on December 7, 1979.\"\" This sort of close repetition should be avoided, especially in the lead summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one other point I could see as significant enough to restoresomewhat abbreviatedis this: \"\"The film came together only days before the premiere; Wise always felt that the theatrical version was a rough cut of the film he wanted to make.\"\" (As a minor point, \"\"tightened and new scenes\"\" is a bit awkward; in this case, the previous phrasing\"\"tightened and added scenes\"\"is better and still works grammatically in the sentence's new structure.)   \"\n",

      "I just heard a bug reference in the movie - Edison, The Man (1940) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison,_The_Man - towards the end of the movie when Edison determines that his two dynamos have a problem because the speed governors were not synced until he mechanically linked them. \n",

And the movie itself is from 1940, which is earlier than when it was first used for software. It seems likely that \"\"bugs\"\" was an engineering term before it made it into software.\"\n",

Furthermore, no one has mentioned the costs of electrolysis using hydro-electric power, tidal, or wind.  In an ocean based plant using the sea water (a natural electrolyte which electrolyzes better than pure water) with tidal power, wind, and solar operating in tandem the costs would be VERY cheap.  And, the costs must be considered to be amortized over the lifetime of the plant.  Solar panels, windmills, and tidal generators have a one-time, fixed cost, and then they run basically for free until repairs become necessary.  \n",

People conveniently overlook all the factors that don't suit their basic belief or economic interest.

Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:\n",

      "Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.\n",
      "Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. \n",
      "Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. \n",
      "Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.\n",

Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\".

Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia.

By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",

If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  \"\n",

      "It was; the Shakespeare question was the one I was not replying to. But to answer your subsequent question, I care because it shows the development process of the play. Taking this hypothetical Shakespeare scenario, it would tell us about his writing process, and perhaps a little of the politics of theatre in his era. Was it delayed because of writer's block? Were elements of the play changed from the way he envisaged/first drew it out because of that? How did it change the theme, climax, or emotion of the show? Was it delayed because the people in power (ie. the theatre owners) disagreed with the play he had created (imagine their reaction if it centred around a homosexual relationship back in that day!)? Or was it perhaps the actors who disagreed with the roles they had to take on? Again that leads us into how Shakespeare worked around the writing problems so that the play could, eventually, go forwards. Or perhaps he had financial issues and that delayed aspects of production. I am not a fan of Billy Shakespeare, but I would find any and all of that information to be most interesing. I would counter that it is, in fact, essential information for the article.

It is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway, the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.\"\"\n",

America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become \"\"a very powerful and scary radicalized community\"\".  \n",

You are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the Midwest, before I'kk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. It certainly is not unique to the Midwest, a region which was not even settled by English speakers until barely 150 years ago, after the northern accent was known to exist in places like Pennsylvania and upstate NY, and Connecticut. It really bugs me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast. The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same. And we've been speaking this way since before the Midwest was even settled, so it's nonsense to say it's a Midwest accent.\"\n",

Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time.

      "\n",
      "David Shankbone's attitude toward authors who don't like the photos he's taken of them is bossy and bullying.  He takes disastrous photos of authors.  Taking more unflattering photos could hardly be possible (See Edmund White, A.M. Homes, Francine Prose, Kathryn Harrison, Mary Gaitskill).  It's gotten to the point that authors he hasn't assaulted yet with his camera are afraid to go to readings for fear he'll be there, waiting for them.   I don't spend much time on Wikipedia, but when I come upon an author's page with a terrible photo, I now know it's been taken by David Shankbone.  I became curious about how these authors felt about the photos he'd taken of them, so I went and looked back in the history of a couple of them.  First I checked in the history of A.M. Homes, and sure enough, someone tried to take down the Shankbone photo (possibly even A.M. Homes herself or someone close to her), saying it was not a good photo, and he repeatedly put it back.  I also looked in the history of Sharyn November, and she herself had an exchange with him on one of their talk pages saying she preferred another photo of herself instead, but he would not let her have her way, and I don't remember the details, but his attitude was unpleasant and bossy.  She quickly backed down sweetly. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few days ago I came upon yet another disastrous author photo by David Shankbone and decided to Google his name, because I've been thinking that sooner or later an article will inevitably come out in the print media about authors' frustrations with this offensive photographer.  I wanted to see if any articles had been published yet about it.  I didn't dig very deeply but did find that on February 18th, 2008, lots of Wikipedia editors wrote about their frustrations with David Shankbone (in a section called: Does Wikipedia want David Shankbone or should we just tell him to leave?), to the point that he promised he'd leave Wikipedia (he shouldn't make promises he won't keep-he didn't even leave for one day, as far as I can see from his list of contributions).   All those posts from upset people have been deleted from Wikipedia, but I was able to find them by going into the history of the page: Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Authors are not the only celebrities Shankbone has upset.  I came upon discussions (on Wikipedia) about the actor Mike Farrell, who was upset by the photo Shankbone took of him, but Shankbone insisted his photo stay up on Farrell's page (it has now been replaced by a much better photo taken by someone else).  And I'm sure it's happened to countless other “notables”.  Many notable authors who are distressed by their photo will just remain quiet and try not to look at their Wikipedia pages, either because they don't know how to take down photos and post messages on Wikipedia, or because they fear that fighting David Shankbone will be futile and will  only increase their distress.  \n",
      "Authors are often shy and insecure about their physical appearance.  Why make it worse?  And why be stubborn and nasty about it to the few authors who do muster up the courage to request that an unflattering photo be taken down? \n",
      "\n",
      "As with any contributor to Wikipedia, David Shankbone should have no right to assert that his photos take precedence over the photos of others, especially when more appropriate pictures are available and copyright free.  He claims that he has allowed better pictures to take the place of his, but this is clearly not true in many instances, given the way he fights to retain his pictures even in instances when any reasonable third party observer would agree that another picture is either better or more appropriate for the article.  \n",

He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.\n",

Let me start by saying that the title \"\"Humanistic Buddhism\"\" is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into \"\"Buddhist Humanism\"\".

Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.\n",

Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: \"\"Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community\"\" http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.html\n",

      "\n",
      " I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as \"\"Chinese\"\" Buddhism and \"\"Japanese\"\" Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing \"\"passport\"\" added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. \n",

      " Wikipedia articles must be impartial and must bring various views. Humanistic values of Buddhism cannot be patented to this temple or that priest only. All respect worthy people working to spread Buddhist Humanism must be acknowledged. I am doing research to include the participation of various Mahayana schools in the teachings of Humanism of the Buddha teachings which are for all Humanity.

      " There are several books, journal articles, chapters of bioethics textbooks, etc. that have been written specifically on the topic of this article (unethical, nonconsensual, and/or illegal medical experiments in the U.S.). They clearly separate this topic from that of human subject research in the United States in general.\n",
      " There exist articles for several other nations that are similar to this one, such as Nazi human experimentation, North Korean human experimentation, Japanese human experimentation. They exist for the same reason that this one should exist  numerous high-quality reliable sources have identified these topics as worthy of study in themselves.\n",
      " A wide array of reliable sources have identified this article's topic as worthy of standing alone as an object of analysis, separate from the broader history of human subject research in general. Per WP:NOTABLE that means that the topic of this article is worth of its own article. Just because many of the experiments in this article are things that most people would consider \"\"bad\"\" (which is why most medical ethics textbooks generally use them as illustrations of \"\"bad science\"\") does not mean that it is \"\"biased\"\" to have an article on them. WP:NPOV does not say that articles can't be about \"\"bad things\"\". It says that we should neutrally report what reliable sources have to say about things, regardless of our moral/ethical views on them. This article neutrally reports what medical ethics texts, and histories of this topic have to say about it. I am not aware of anywhere in the article where it is not neutrally reporting what reliable sources are saying. \n",

      "Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word \"\"vandalism\"\" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a \"\"content dispute\"\", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is \"\"winning\"\" or \"\"losing\"\". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:\n",
      "After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. \n",
      "I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as \"\"vandals\"\", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.\n",
      "Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.\n",
      "Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.\n",
      "I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.\n",

      "The following material has been challenged by two separate IP editors, and restored by one editor (Altenmann). Having reviewed it, it does not appear to be in an encyclopedic style and requires a rewrite. As such, I've posted it here for discussion and reworking to avoid disruption. The text in dispute is as follows:\n",

      "Pincus offers managerial advice on handling difficulties caused by both types: she defines the know-it-all as the \"\"Truly Smart Know-It-All\"\", an employee with \"\"a intellectual handle on the job requirements that is spectacular\"\", but who \"\"doesn't 'see' boundaries\"\", and the omniscient deity as a person who \"\"thinks nothing of imposing or intruding\"\". Lloyd makes no such distinction, although he notes that ironically, Know-It-Alls can sometimes know what they are talking about, and simply have such a brusque style of communication that people are unwilling to listen. He characterizes Know-It-Alls as superficially domineering and controlling, but insecure underneath. The outward focus on the inferiority of their fellows is intended to mask the inner sense of their own weaknesses in knowledge, skills, and competence.\n",
      " \n",
      "Pincus recommends different strategies for each type. For the case of the Truly Smart Know-It-All she observes that a manager might have to bend the rules somewhat to accommodate the negative aspects of such an employee, which include impatience, an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and other peculiarities, in order to retain the positive benefits of the employee's knowledge and experience. Although she also cautions that managers have to weigh the benefits against the taxing effects, upon managers and staff, of employing an \"\"outlandish prima donna\"\". She also recommends that rule-bending not extend to allowing the peculiarities of a true know-it-all with odd habits to be displayed to outsiders, such as customers and other visitors, and that such employees be clearly requested not to flout their eccentricities when such visitors call. She also states that managers should not be afraid of asking a genius employee questions, and should insist upon mutual respect and not adopt a self-deprecating attitude simply in order to placate such employees. Lloyd similarly advises managers to take a strong line against any form of intellectual bullying, either of others or indeed of the manager.\n",
      " \n",
      "For the Know-It-All who doesn't, Pincus recommends to managers that they give praise where it is due, and that they assign such employees to work together with one, or two, other people, and regularly check for signs of stress. Notess observes that the last tactic mentioned can be unsuccessful if a Know-It-All is paired with a novice, since the Know-It-All quickly takes control away from the novice.\n",
      " \n",
      "LLoyd observes that getting a point across to a Know-It-All can sometimes be difficult, and require much repetition, because such people are more interested in what they themselves are saying than in listening to others.\n",

      "You will never get anywhere with the likes of Keepcalmandcarryon, Mastcell, Nunh-huh, etc. Going into the archives of some of the articles here on AIDS and HIV, I found that some of these people have been working, full-time it seems, on keeping these pages biased for years, and that they don't allow any edits which provide alternative information to the orthodox theory that HIV=AIDS, or anyone attached to these theories. They can be illogical, bullying, they will name-call, they will call any persons with honest questions denialists, and they will use any and every strategy no matter how ugly to keep these pages the way they want them to read. They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die. I wonder if these mercenary editors here have any idea that their policing of these pages could be leading to actual deaths in the world, as thousands of people take poison in a desperate attempt to save their lives, when they are not even sick.\n",

      "\n",
      "The retaking of Bani Walid highlights the vulnerability of Libya's new leaders, who have faced mounting criticism as they struggle to unify the oil-rich North African nations and build state institutions from scratch three months after Gadhafi was captured and killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seizure also appeared to be the first major, organized operation by armed remnants of Gadhafi's regime, adding to the security woes of the ruling National Transitional Council. The council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces. Instead it is left reliant on multiple \"\"revolutionary brigades,\"\" militias made up of citizens-turned-fighters, usually all from a specific city or even neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The militias were created during the months of civil war against Gadhafi's forces last year and when the war ended in October, the various brigades remain in control of security affairs of each city they liberated. Though loyal to the NTC, they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative, and the council has been unable to control them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hundreds of well-equipped and highly trained remnants of Gadhafi's forces battled for eight hours in Bani Walid with the local revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, which was eventually driven out, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The Gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday's attack, he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and 25 others were wounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city, a longtime Gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to NTC rule late last year.\"\"The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28, now it is gone and 99 percent of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists,\"\" said the head of Bani Walid's military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, confirming the fall of the city. He spoke to The Associated Press at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed, with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.\n",
      "\n",
      "A top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatmani, who was present in Benghazi during the attack, says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town.The three officials said the attackers belong to Brigade 93, a militia newly created by Gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime. The fighters, flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs, have been increasing in power in the city, they said.\n",

Che himself never shunned away from acknowledging the \"\"radical\"\" nature of the transformational Marxist world revolution which he believed was necessary, and in fact saw the term if anything as a compliment.

I disagree as the the part in question speaks directly to the bio where Sunny Hostin is described as “... a former Assistant US Attorney, as well as a legal expert and TV personality, who is often called upon for her analysis on various provocative issues and high-profile criminal cases in the news.” The information speaks to her abilities, case knowledge, quality of opinion and ethical standards displayed during and after a nationally streamed debate on a preeminent legal question. Thus the information is directly on point (not random) as regards legal analysis and adds considerably to readers' understanding of legal bias and ethical standards.   Given there is no dispute of the accuracy of the information, the insert should stand.\n",

      "I would hope that you read both the source and my points fully before making your edit and writing your response.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I initially said the source is biased - it is true. They state themselves that their very organisation was set up initially purely to oppose Nuclear Power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's leave that to one side however, we could always come back to it later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crux of my point, leaving aside the bias issue, is three-fold. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim, the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical - there is no fair comparator for the claim that \"\"Nuclear Power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions\"\". A fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz. inefficiency should be presented, if even from the biased source itself, before re-inserting this part. Without it, it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as \"\"some people claim that Ferraris are not fast machines\"\". Not exactly the sort of style an Encyclopaedia should be aiming for, especially on a scientific article, would you not agree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, with respect to your argument, the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to, if I may say, a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers. It is  a self-contradicting source. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes its supposition that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions by producing a table of data. The data shows \"\"Yearly Costs to Avoid 1000kg of CO2 Emissions\"\". These are divided between Energy Conservation Measures and Energy Production Methods. Nuclear Power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions. However, the only conclusion the article draws is that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions. By your logic, I could equally claim in this article using the same source that \"\"some environmental groups claim Wind and Solar Power are inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions\"\". You can see how this would get a little crazy, no?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, there is only one quoted source yet the text reads \"\"but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions, excluding it from clean energy\"\". Why is it pluralised? Surely the text should read something along the lines of \"\"the WISE group, a Dutch anti-nuclear lobby group indicate the problems...\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline - as a claim, it is not presented as fact. That would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues, or political issues or any other number of normative debates. But we are not discussing ethics here. We are discussing the efficiency of Nuclear Power in cutting CO2 Emissions. We have to hold Scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to \"\"making claims\"\" or worse, \"\"stating beliefs\"\". Science, prima facie, is about the pursuit of absolute truth, not the espousal of circumscribed belief. That way leads to the abuse of Science.\n",

      "\n",
      "A few English universities now offer the degree of \"\"Doctor of Engineering\"\" (EngD), which, like the PhD, is also a research-based degree, but differs from the traditional UK PhD in several important ways. Specifically,\n",
      "\n",
      "1) A PhD degree is normally pursued full-time by a student while in residence in a university department under the supervision of a faculty member. Accordingly, PhD-level research is more speculative/abstract in nature, with an emphasis on producing results that may be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and are of academic interest. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The EngD on the other hand is normally pursued by a candidate while he/she works as an employee in an outside company. Most EngD research is carried out in a designated industry (as opposed to a university department or lab) and is jointly supervised by both an industrial and a university supervisor. Accordingly, EngD-level research tends to be application-oriented in nature and designed to meet the specific needs/interests of the industrial sponsor. EngD candidates are still required to produce original research that makes a significant contribution to existing knowledge on his/her field, but, in many programmes (AmEng \"\"programs\"\"), it is customary for EngD candidates to submit a portfolio of engineering projects in lieu of a longer monographic thesis to fulfil (AmEng \"\"fulfill\"\") the requirements for the degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) EngD programmes normally include a more formal coursework requirement than the traditional English PhD. It should be stressed however that many engineering departments in the UK (e.g. at Cambridge) now require that PhD students take lecture courses and their associated written exams in their first year in the programme. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) (POV) No matter what the Research Councils say, the EngD is still generally seen in academic circles as inferior to a PhD. For example, I doubt an EngD would be acceptable as a qualification for appointment as a Lecturer in a university, whereas the PhD of course is the standard qualification in England for an entry-level faculty position. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of its industry-oriented nature, the EngD is normally referred to in English academic circles as a \"\"professional degree\"\", even though it remains a research degree as emphasized above\n",

      "The Frat Pack is a 1990s-2000s era nickname given to a group of male Hollywood comedy actors who have appeared together in many of the highest grossing movies since the late 1990s, including Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, and Steve Carell. It was coined by USA Today in a story from June 2004.USATODAY.com - Wilson and Vaughn: Leaders of the 'Frat Pack' Before USA Today dubbed this group the Frat Pack, Entertainment Weekly referred to them as the \"\"Slacker Pack,\"\" but this term is rarely used.  Meanwhile, EW had earlier used the term Frat Pack to describe Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Edward Norton, and Ryan Phillippe, but this usage has not been seen elsewhere. Since then, EW has dropped the \"\"Slacker Pack\"\" term, and also began referring to the group as the Frat Pack .  The name is a take-off of the Rat Pack, a nickname given to a group of entertainers in the 1950s and 1960s combined with the shorthand term for a college fraternity, a reference to the group's popular film, Old School. In December 2007, Italian cinema magazine Nocturno published the first 70 pages dossier completely dedicated to the Frat Pack phenomenon.\n",

      "The USA Today article which coined the Frat Pack term listed Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and brothers Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson as members of the group.  By 2006, Steve Carell was also included in the Pack when USA Today published another article.  Carell claimed membership when hosting Saturday Night Live. Though he did not use the term \"\"Frat Pack,\"\" he did say he was \"\"one of those guys now\"\" and specifically referenced Stiller, Vaughn, Ferrell, Owen Wilson, and Black.\n",
      "\n",
      "A year before citing Carell as a member, USA Today tagged him, in addition to Judd Apatow, Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Mindy Kaling, Nancy Walls and Leslie Mann as the Frat Pack's \"\"Junior Varsity.\"\" USATODAY.com - Carell just wants some love Kaling and Walls haven't been as associated with the group elsewhere, but Details Magazine has cited Apatow (in addition to directors McKay and Phillips) as \"\"The Frat Packagers\"\",The Power 50: DETAILS Article on men.style.com while Paul Rudd was cited as a Frat Pack member in the New York Post, among other publications.

Adam McKay directed Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.  Judd Apatow is the writer/producer of several Frat Pack comedies including Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.

What concerns me now is that it's a self-published paper that relies heavily on hearsay, and makes no attempt to source things that are now being extracted from it as if they're facts. The one example I used is of great concern to me, but there are others on the Mason Remey and BUPC pages that are also contentious. I'm curious if it's merits are defendable beyond what's been cited above already, because it appears to only be a self-published paper and should only be used as such IMO.\n",

I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... \n",

If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the \"\"explanation\"\" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make \"\"heads and tails\"\" of. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then I'm Santa, Cladism is not science, but rather a reaction against science). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )\"\n",

      "You can't have it both ways. You're either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you're a fansite. Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite.\n",
      "Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed.\n",
      "As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no \"\"freebie\"\" section for links.

To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, \"\"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others.\"\" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.\n",

However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd.

      "The link for the revised article is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)/new \n",
      "Thanks for taking a look. From what you wrote above, I understand that you do not mind replacing the old version with the revised text on the main page. I would very much want to get other editors of good will involved. All best  \n",
      "I think it would be more accurate to say, the revised outline seems to resolve the sensationalist approach of the old version. However, and this is what will take the time, the old version does have merits which should not be lost. There is an energy among some people to show that Berezovsky is a mafia-like boss. When I told a friend about Berezovsky and the accusations of his involvement as such a boss and how I would like to email him and ask him to donate a picture for the article, my friend expressed shock and dismay that I would risk my life so. The article needs the balanced outline of the revised version but should deal with both sides of the view of him. This balance is what takes the time. I would enjoy helping. Your energy for the article is obvious. If we could get an editor who wants to portray Berezovsky as a mafia boss to agree to the balanced outline and then to enter some careful rules of collaboration, the article could strengthen quickly. In the article I am working on presently, one other editor is active and he is very critical. But, he and I have finally agreed to work with the talk pages and to talk more civilly with each other and things are progressing much better. Similar cooperation could happen for the Berezovsky article. Rely on Secondary Sources. Insist on a conservative, scholarly examination of all aspect of Berezovsky's life. And, yes, I still want to email him, ask him for a picture, and perhaps go for coffee. )      \n",
      "Dear DonaldRichardSands, thank you for your input. Of course, Mr. Berezovsky is a highly controversial person, and I think, all these controversies are reflected in the revised text. But he is a major figure, who influenced Russian political history over two decades, and his biography deserves professional approach not only for his own sake, but for the sake of the whole Russia block on Wikipedia. With respect, the belief of \"\"some people\"\" that Berezovsky is a mafia boss is an opinion, which is not supported by facts. If an opinion is poorly sourced and potentially libelous, it has no place on Wikipedia, regardless of how many people may hold it. Otherwise we should change the rules and make Wikipedia a collection of opinions supported by a majority vote. Under current rules, we should work with well sourced facts. The facts in this matter are as follows. (1) That particular opinion has originated from a single source (Mr. Klebnikov), whose antisemitic bias has been noted by three respectable independent sources. (2) The publication (Forbes), which printed his opinion has unequivocally retracted it as lacking any evidence in a libel court hearing. (3) Dozens of profiles of Mr. Berezovsky in major world newspapers, which adhere to the standards of fair and responsible journalism - including serious Russian sources - do not repeat these allegations. I believe that Wikipedia should adhere to the same standards. The revised article states the sourced facts as they are: there was an opinion voiced, which was then discredited. Of course, if anyone can quote another reputable source, which supports this opinion with evidence, it should be mentioned. Since I am going on vacation, I have put the revised text on the main page, and leave it for the community to compare it with the previous version (which can be accessed via History tag), amend, challenge and comment - as long as it is done by the rules. The last thing I want is another edit war. On the other hand, seeking consensus is just one of Wikipedia rules. Avoiding pushing opinions, and removing unsourced slander is another.  \"\n",

You don't see him removing Jewish categories from any other pages, and there are many people in Jewish categories who are not notable for being Jewish. So then why does this rule only apply to Irish Republican Catholics? And of course, the church will condemn any form of violence.

      "It's totally uncontroversial that a massive increase in the money supply will cause hyperinflation.  Virtually any economist will agree that a big increase in the money supply is a possible trigger for hyperinflation, even if they don't believe it's the only one.  To say imply that neo-liberal economists don't believe that some hyperinflations are initially triggered by monetary expansion is to caricature their position.\n",
      "It's totally uncontroversial that loss of confidence in the monetary system has a big role in hyperinflation.  To imply that monetarists don't see a role for reestablishing confidence in the currency - that just 'stopping the printing presses' is enough - is just misleading.  Monetarists talk about ways of establishing confidence all the time.\n",

Much or most of the comments and theology of Matt Slick are derived from his website, the Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry.

      "Thanks, impartial reader, but your comments are a little on the general side.  Based on bitter personal experience over many years, I've long given up on achieving \"\"consensus\"\" on something as controversial of monetary theory.  As Gregalton has pointed out on the debt-based monetary system talk page, it's not like \"\"quilting\"\".  How money should be produced and distributed in the modern economy is (if you hadn't already noticed) a slightly contentious issue.  Contentious enough for the argument to be concluded with an assassin's bullet (at least according to some monetary historians).  The question is not my manners, which I acknowledge are non-existent, but whether someone should DELETE what I have written ON MY OWN TALK PAGE on this basis, and threaten ominously \"\"you will not be warned again\"\" (I'm now reflexively turning around all the time to check how long Coren's knife is).  Instead of deleting and threatening, how about editors take the time to make constructive comments and suggestions to amend the text?  I can live with not being liked.  However if someone wants to take the time to actively \"\"terminate\"\" me ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, they can't expect to do it without a fight and some risk to their own... how should I put this... tranquility.  Alternatively they can leave me the Hell alone and let others read what they want to read.  No one is pushing anyone's face into the computer screen to read what I've writen.

      "I have a question that might seem obvious to most people but has always confused me.  Ok, so a cocktail weapon is made with a bottle of gasoline and then a gas soaked rag stuffed into the opening of the bottle right?  Since gas ignites so quickly wouldn't this design mean that the bomb will always explode in the hands of the user before they throw it, much less hit the target?  I mean, gasoline fires spread extremely fast, so it just seems to me that once you light the soaked rag, the fire would hit the gas in the bottle in a second or less.  I'm sure it's a simple answer, but this has always seemed weird to me.  rvinall\n",

      "In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.\n",

No other mainstream media has reported on it. And again the everlasting propaganda war of this civil war.

      "The roots of IBM date back the the 1880s, decades before the development of electronic computers. The company was formed through a merger of three different companies: the Tabulating Machine Company (with origins in Washington, D.C. in the 1880s), the International Time Recording Company (founded 1900 in Endicott), and the Computing Scale Corporation (founded 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, USA)..  The merger was engineered by noted financier Charles Flint, and the new company was called the Computing Tabulating Recording (CTR) CorporationMartin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray, Computer a History of the Information Machine — Second Edition, Westview Press, pages 37–39 2004. CTR was incorporated on June 16 1911 in Endicott, New York, U.S.A.. Flint remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in 1930.\n",
      "\n",
      "The companies that merged to form CTR manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, coffee grinders, and most importantly for the development of the computer, punched card equipment. The product lines were very different, but Flint believed that since they all focused on equipment that made businesses more efficient, there were synergies and cross selling opportunities to be had.  Based in New York City, the new company had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the companies merged to form CTR, the most technologically significant was the Tabulating Machine Company, founded by Herman Hollerith, and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879–82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punch cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input. officemuseum.com – early Hollerith history, with good photographs of period equipment\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tabulating Machine Company originally sold some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day - the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract, and completing the project with amazing speed, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. But creating markets for the new technology was a struggle, and by 1911 Hollerith, now 51 and in failing health, was looking to rest on his laurels. He sold the business to  Flint for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million), who then created C-T-R. Hollerith remained involved with C-T-R for some years as a consultant, but his involvement waned as time went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the diversified businesses of C-T-R proved difficult to manage, Flint turned for help to the former No. 2 executive at the National Cash Register Company, Thomas J. Watson Sr.. Watson became General Manager of C-T-R in 1914 and President in 1915. I Drawing upon his managerial experience at NCR, Watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics: generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen, and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker. As the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company, Watson focused their\n",

Both of these quotes were made by Raeky, and it has interfered with the discussion of the issues I brought up, so I used a warning template. I am GENUINELY concerned with these two articles, and contrary to any belief, I am not out to get evolution. Evolution can become twice as popular for all I care. I feel I have been hindered trying to discuss neutrality issues in one article, and a contradiction between evolution as theory and fact and fact.

      "Hi, I dont really care much for the Serb/Albanian disputes but I thought it was common knowledge that Kosovo is an autonomous province of Serbia (at least theoretically). The way it is written it makes it sound that Kosovo is a province of Yugoslavia. I am pretty sure this is not the case otherwise its position under international law would be similar to that of Montenegro and independence would be much less of a problem than it is at this point. The article should be unprotected and reference to Serbia should be included. I dont think Albanian wikipedians should try to stop this from happening. The problem (and paradox) of Kosovo still being part of Serbia is not going to go away by negating it on wikipedia. If I were Kosovar Albanian i would be trying to make this be known so as to find a solution for the future of my territory.\n",

      "Using the light green color for Crimea seems somewhat misleading and inconsistent. The China map uses the same light green color for Taiwan, even though the situations are not similar at all: China has no control over Taiwan and the people don't want to join China. Russia has total control over Crimea with the approval of its people. In reality Crimea is not a contested territory, except in the minds of politicians. I think Crimea should be labeled as fully part of Russia on the Russia page, and marked with some other color on the Ukraine page that represents territorial claims without control. This should be the same color used for Taiwan on the china page. A different color should be used to mark contested territories (where multiple parties have actual influence over, say if Crimea was controlled by Russia, but its people were not happy with the Russians and were protesting/rebelling).\n",

This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent (not a terrorist), even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.\n",

The whole point of such changes in BC is confrontation and revanchism and an opportunity to overturn the colonial landscape and smooth ruffled cultural egos, and \"\"getting even with whitey\"\" is very much part of the motive, as with Chinaman's Peak becoming Ha Ling Peak (in Alberta) or various Chinaman Lakes becoming China Lake (they don't have problems with anything being called Chinatown, though, and seem intent on popularizing the term for anywhere with some condo residents from HK and a couple of Chinese-only stores).  The rationalizations for Salish Sea included \"\"elders\"\" talking about how it was \"\"the ancient name\"\" and \"\"the correct name\"\", even though it's not only Salishan peoples who lived around it, nor that that word is a misappropriation of an Interior Salishan's people to the whole language group.  So these \"\"fictive\"\" names (Haida Gwaii is of early '70s or late '60s coinage, ONLY) are often cultural justapositions to start with; in one case, Sto:lo, which should be the name of the river, it's come into use for a grouping of Halkomelem-speaking peoples formerly known as the Fraser River Indians - even the term Cowdigin/Cowichan, now confined to a certain area of Vancouver Island, applied to all the peoples up to Yale; my piont being that if they wanted to rename the Fraser River, they should have thought of that before making \"\"Fraser River\"\" their name in their own language.  It also doesn't help that the way our languages give names to some kinds of things, native languages don't label the landscape in the same way; they may name a particular flank or toe of a mountain, or for an eddy in the river that has some story attached to it; they may not have a name for the adjacent land(forms).  Anyway the point of the native-name movement is largely to drive \"\"white\"\" names off the landscape entirely...they just don't have enough replacement names to go around, and the political inertia is incredible....as noted the only reason Campbell cut the Haida name deal was so he could get them to sign onto an indepednent power proposal for his campaign donors....  \"\n",

      "I recently changed the season colour schemes to more accurately match their respective DVD/Blu-ray cases, as it seems to be the standard on Wikipedia. Not to my surprise it was met with a quick revert. I understand the editors argument that the colour for seasons 1 and 3 are quite similar, but in all honesty it does not matter. The two seasons are not directly chronological in nature, therefore there is no issue with differentiation. Following some sort of makeshift standard is desirable when it comes to the colour schemes on television seasons because it keeps petty arguments and debates from arising, similar to the ones above. I am all for following the unspoken standard; changing these schemes to match their marketing material. Please, let me know what you think. Cheers,\n",

      " Re 1 and 2: I don't have access to any additional facilities.  I am a run-of-the-mill editor like you, not an administrator.  Flagging suspected copyright violations is something any editor can do; it does not require administrator privileges.  The procedure for doing this is described on WP:CP.  It does take an administrator to delete a page, however, which is the usual result from suspected copyright violations.  The notice is posted on the article in question, and on the WP:CP page, nowhere else.  Again, I have no subscription to EB, nor any tools except search engines for detecting copyright violations.\n",
      " Re 3: If you scroll down WP:CP, you'll see it consists mainly of reports, with the occasional comment, many of which are not from the original poster.  Typically the original contributor does not respond at all within the seven day window.  There are many new contributors who happily copy-and-paste from other websites, with utter disregard of their copyright notices, and our policies.  Have a look at some of the listed items for examples.  Most entries on the WP:CP page are in dated sections under \"\"New listings\"\", but some have \"\"fallen off the top\"\" into \"\"Older than 7 days\"\".  \n",
      " Re 4: If you look at the original report on WP:CP#July 11, you'll see that  listed that URL.  Presumably the same URL also appeared in the original copyright notice.  How that URL was found, I have no idea, but I would suspect search engines before spyware.  8-)  It's by a human comparison of that page with yours that I perceive a certain amount of similarity in phrasing and structure.  I'm prepared to accept that it's within the bounds of coincidence.\n",
      " Re 5: You are correct; permit me to clarify.  People often reproduce text from other websites citing permission with various constraints like \"\"in Wikipedia\"\", \"\"for non-commercial purposes\"\", \"\"providing it is quoted without alteration\"\", or \"\"on condition that the source is credited in a particular way\"\".  Unfortunately, none of those (except perhaps the last) is satisfactory for text in Wikipedia for the reasons I explained above.\n",
      " Re 6: New articles can be seen at Special:Newpages.  Changes to all articles can be seen at Special:Recentchanges.  Everyone has their own criteria for which entries they check, but most people are more suspicious of anonymous users than of logged in users.\n",
      " I note with regret that  has just blocked you for 24 hours.  In the same circumstances, were I an administrator, I would probably not have done this, but you have to admit that you did twist each other's tails quite a bit.  Perhaps this will give you a chance to concentrate on your other project.  8-) Note that you can still edit your user page, and I think you can still send e-mails using the \"\"E-mail this user\"\" link.  I'll add a note to both entries on WP:CP that we are in a dialogue.\n",
      " This is probably an unnecessary remark, but I feel I should point out that if you edit Wikipedia from a different address and identify yourself to me, I will feel obliged to report it as block evasion.  This is independent of my feelings about the block itself.  Sorry.\n",

The internet is FULL of sites like yours (which you are definitely promoting by placing these links everywhere) and access to them is so simple.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and NOT a place to pop links in just because it's the same topic.  When the above message says to add content instead of links, it is because external links are useless to a real encyclopedia.  If possible, we try to link internally, and externally link only to resources for the articles.  There are plenty of Ronaldinho links and sites with videos that display his skills; they should not be linked here.  Please, please, stop plugging your site under the guise of adding valuable encyclopedic content.  You may very well mean well, but this just isn't the place for this specific link.

      "\"What I was saying was that South Africa was never a \"\"black\"\" country. The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, \"\"independecne\"\" and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under \"\"deliberate discrimination\"\". There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems. That's part of what I meant.\n",

I've been heavily involved in OWS since last October, which means two things: 1) I know a bunch of stuff first-hand, including things the media has failed to document, and 2) sometimes an NPOV is going to be difficult for me to maintain. That said, I have many concerns with this article, mostly on the facts. For example, this quote above: the rules of Zuccotti Park aren't self-justifying; this quote and others in the article seem to indicate that they are actually material. They're not; they don't actually exist; there is a rule-making procedure that is required by city law which the police and Brookfield have totally ignored. So, using them to explain police action without quoting or citing a police source is not NPOV. Secondly, these rules have nothing to do with the police tactics used that day, which were employed all over the Financial District, well outside the region where the \"\"rules\"\" of Zuccotti Park apply. What happened was the police grab whoever they feel like at any given moment, apply laws like the disorderly conduct statute willy-nilly (\"\"blocking pedestrian traffic\"\" is frequently absurdly applied), and have a goal not of enforcing laws but of maintaining an extralegal standard of order. This is called \"\"crowd control policing\"\", and it explicitly involves unconstitutional conduct and arrests. Remember, sometimes a point of view is political despite being neutral, i.e. based in empirical observation and fact. Thanks for your work, and perhaps you can offer some guidance as to how first-person expertise can properly be used to make sure a wiki article is factual and not based on flawed or incomplete media interpretation.  \n",

I agree that the \"\"two species\"\" claim is false, and that the reference proves it (planktonic larvae can be easier to find than animals living on the sea floor at depths of >2000 m, so it's not that surprising that species have been missed). I wasn't sure if someone else would find a good way of re-wording it and save the DYK entry; I certainly couldn't think of one, but I didn't vote it down just in case. That DOI is an odd thing indeed. Springer Link definitely gives the same DOI I put in the article, but dx.doi.org doesn't recognise it. It's not even as if it's a very new article that hasn't made it into the DOI database yet. I have added a link directly to the journal article; I am wary of removing the DOI, because it *ought* to be right, although I doubt that it will come back to life. At least this way, people will find the article if they need to. Oh, and thanks for rescuing the conservation status of the Steppe Field Mouse.

It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel.\n",

Whatever people think of me, I'm not the sort of idiot who goes around getting articles put up for AFD just so I can then say they should be kept.

      "From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's \"\"Meet the Press\"\" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\"\"I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,\"\" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, \"\"I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,\"\" the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be \"\"a little awkward\"\" for him back in Washington.\"\"They played by the traditional partisan political playbook. And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,\"\" Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.\"\"I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' \"\" he said.\"\"I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,\"\" Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (\"\"D.\"\")] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s. Before that, the last senator to use the designation was in the mid-19th century, he said.link  17:36\"\n",

      "\"Why is it that a page that can garner such passionate attitudes, as they concern the treatment and consuming of animals, cannot stick to the subject matter?  Surely, even the most ardent supporter of animal rights can see that this is simply supposed to be a list of material facts about an aspect of human behavior that has existed in one form or another since the dawn of time?  There are many other places on Wikipedia where they can read and contribute their individual viewpoints on the ethical, moral and practical points of animal consumption.  I do not wish to enter into personal attacks, and will not on an individual level, but there seem to be quite a few people who are either too stupid or too self-centered to leave their personal opinions out of an encyclopedia article.  Can anyone imagine opening a copy of an Encyclopedia Britannica to the \"\"Slaughterhouses\"\" entry only to find a jumbled mess of a few verifiable facts mixed in with opinions and hysterical rants about how terrible are slaughterhouses and meat eaters?  Why can't these people understand that this is simply a webpage that is attempting to describe what is a slaughterhouse, what it does, where they operate, how they operate, and what types of animals they process?  There would be no opinions stating that slaughterhouses are wonderful, desirable places that exist for the pleasure of some sadistic monsters who kill simply for the pleasure of it.  Likewise, there will not be any sections condemning slaughterhouses and all people who either work there or utilize the products that are produced in such a place.  This article, once completed satisfactorily, will simply be a repository of verifiable facts about slaughterhouses, their genesis, their necessity (as it stands right now in our modern world), and their operating procedures.  Yes, there will be facts about the historical conditions, including, I am sure, mention of Upton Sinclair's \"\"The Jungle.\"\"  Also, there will most likely be a small section that notes these vegetarians' and vegans' attitudes and activities concerning slaughterhouses.  In this aforementioned small section, I can imagine that there will be external links leading to Wikipedia pages that support these vegetarians' and vegans' points of view.  Now, what is wrong with that?  A place for everything, and everything in its place?  Oh, and if you are still confused about what is a fact and what is an opinion, an \"\"opinion\"\" is explained in detail on a (what else?) Wikipedia page residing here: \"\"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion,\"\" and it says something like this, for starters: \"\"1. An opinion is a subjective statement or thought about an issue or topic, and is the result of emotion or interpretation of facts...\"\"  NOW do you see the difference?

A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer \"\"they are the only true adherents of democracy.\"\"[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term \"\"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.\"\"[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only \"\"deeply committed\"\" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is \"\"trivial\"\".[2][3] [4]\n",

      "\n",
      "William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled \"\"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'\"\"[7]\n",

      "The reference to the DMSG, Deutsche Multiple Sklrose Gesselschaft, is problematic. It's a primary source. Is it independent? From what? Organizations form as patient organizations, often, but as they develop, they find sources of funding, often from drug companies, and can end up advocating the interests of drug companies instead of their original constituency. This is not any kind of charge against DMSG directly (maybe someone who can search German sources can tell us more), but such a source does not necessarily stack up well against standard secondary sources, and the Medline article is pretty good and balanced. The headline there is telling: \"\"Endovascular Treatment of Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency Safe, May Provide Benefit in MS.\"\" Obviously, Dr. Jung was correct, such a claim is overstated, if taken as proven, the study was inadequate for that.\n",

That is far from saying that I'd jump for invasive surgery, and caution is exactly appropriate. But having MS is no fun, either, and one would think that information about CCVI and the research going on with respect to it would be prominent on the DMSG home page. The link from the article does not go to a specific page about CCVI, it seems that it might be pointing to a video, but I can't see a translation of that. I was unable to find a page on the DMSG site that justifies the claim in the article. Accordingly, I'll be removing it.\n",

      "This is getting posted on every arb's talk page and I will courtesy notify Doc J. I am appalled at how low the standards of wiki admin behavior have sunk. We've seen admins lose their bit for nothing more than one wheel war and yet here we have multiple instances of involved protections, edit wars, hounding new users, involved blocks, etc, and absolutely nothing gets done about it. Why? So Doc J can \"\"adjust\"\"? What about all his victims? What do they get?diddly squat, just like in the real world. I actually truly hope Doc J can change, but that is not what wiki history teaches us. Wiki history teaches us he will lay low until the heat dies down then steadily go back to his old ways and he'll be back at RFAR within 6-30 months from now. Just like the arb case from my day when a drafting arb came within a hair of posting sanctions on Willbeback but didn't and what happened? Will kept going on in the same old fashion and two years and countless victims later, Will loses his bit and gets banned. And Doc J gets to use a secret mentor? He'd only not disclose that person if he felt the community would not accept the mentor, such as the mentor wasn't neutral or some such reason. By not taking this case and not issuing any guidelines or admonishments, especially with several extremely weak comments by the arbs (ie, how can some of you see nothing wrong in his behavior) all AC did here was send a clear signal to admins that there are no more admin standards of behavior and admins can do whatever they want and get away with it scott free. This juxtaposed with those who lost their bit for one wheel war also shows there is no consistency at all in AC's rulings on admins. At a minimum AC should have issued a statement on unacceptable behavior rather than turning a blind eye to the RFAR. This is an unacceptable precedent for which the community and AC will pay for many times over in the future. The UN can do a better job of fixing things than wiki and AC can, and that's really sad. This is a classic case of how those committing harmful acts rationalize their behavior and others rationalize excuses on their behalf. See you at \"\"RFAR/Jmh649 2\"\". talk \"\n",

      "Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was 10th President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He was a lawyer, member of the Philippine House of Representatives (1949–1959) and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959–1965). He was Senate President in 1963. He claimed to have led a guerrilla force called Ang Maharlika in northern Luzon during the Second World War, something much doubted however to be true.[1][2] As Philippine president and strongman, his greatest achievement was in the fields of infrastructure development and international diplomacy. However, his administration was marred by massive authoritarian corruption, despotism, nepotism, political repression, and human rights violations. He benefited from a large personality cult in the Philippines during his regime.[3] In 1983, his government was implicated in the assassination of his primary political opponent, Benigno Aquino, Jr.. The implication caused a chain of events, including a tainted presidential election that served as the catalyst for the People Power Revolution in February 1986 that led to his removal from power and eventual exile in Hawaii. It was later alleged that he and his wife Imelda Marcos had moved billions of dollars of embezzled public funds to the United States, Switzerland, and other countries, as well as into alleged corporations during his 20 years in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was born September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte outside Laoag City to parents Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin. He was named after Ferdinand VII of Spain and baptized into the Philippine Independent Church. According to the Marcos family's oral history, the family name was originally Taguktok, and their Ilokano roots have some Japanese and Chinese ancestry. Ferdinand was a champion debater at the University of the Philippines, where he also participated in boxing, swimming and wrestling.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 1938, Mariano Marcos, his brother Pio, his son Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo were prosecuted for the murder of Julio Nalundasan. On September 20, 1935, the day after Nalundasan (for the second time) defeated Mariano Marcos for the National Assembly seat for Ilocos Norte, Nalundasan was shot and killed in his house in Batac. According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan, with Ferdinand Marcos eventually doing the killing. In late January 1939, they were denied bail [4] and in the fall[when?] of 1939 they were convicted. Ferdinand and Lizardo received the death penalty for premeditated murder, while Mariano and Pio were found guilty only of contempt of court. The Marcos family took their appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which on October 22, 1940, overturned the lower court's decision and acquitted them of all charges but contempt.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1939, while incarcerated, Ferdinand Marcos graduated cum laude with a law degree from the U.P. College of Law. If he had not been put in jail for twenty seven days, he would have graduated magna cum laude. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society. While in detention, Governor Roque B. Ablan Sr. of Ilocos Norte helped Marcos study for the bar exams by providing a desk lamp in his cell, law books and reviewers. Marcos passed the bar examination with an almost perfect score of 98.01%, while also writing an 830-page defense. Several people contested his score and a retake was taken albeit an oral bar examination witnessed by several people. His second bar examination resulted in a 100% score, the highest grade obtained in the Philippine Bar).[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcos became senator after serving as member of the House of Representatives for three terms. In the Senate he served as minority floor leader before gaining the Senate presidency. He established a record for having introduced a number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the republic's statute books.[7]\n",

Don't worry, you didn't sounds condescending, and I respect the inclusion of a 3rd party (btw: do you mind if I ask who it is?). Anyway, I believe it very superfulous to have a heading labeled plot + a spoiler tag. It seems very redundant, as most people who read that it's the plot, will take it to mean that it contains the whole plot, details, endings and all. As for Joe Schmoe talking in the coffe shop with x and y in town z being what the show is about, that information belongs in a plot introduction, which generally comes before the plot, without any heading.

I just refuse to believe that a pilot with that level of flying experience cant land on a runway in clear, broad daylight without automated assistance. The crash in my opinion is similar to the crash of Turkish Airlines flight 1951 where although the aircraft was a B 737 - 800, none of the 3 pilots who were in the cockpit noticed the drop in airspeed until it was too late for recovery.

I believe all the wrestlers have at least a replica of some sorts of all the titles they ever won. I remember seeing John Cena’s, Trish Stratus’s, and Chyna’s homes with a title belt hanging in their respective walls. I also recall Mick Foley mentioning that he has an “Attitude” version of the old WWF title in his closet. In the case with Hogan, he might actually have the real WCW title in his possession. He is only the greatest “Sports Entertainer” ever. I do mean ever!! However, I’m talking about the title, not the belt. I know that “possession is 9/10 of the law\"\", but in this case, having the physical belt doesn’t make you a champion. Think about Rhyno and the older version of the ECW title.

Created on the basis of lies and today people day on the basis of lies. That´s pure sacrifice of innocent children of Afghanistan who had nothing to do with those lies but they are the victims. Why?? I know many Pashtuns did great damages on non-Pashtuns and devided them by their varieties but in return many non-Pashtuns dominate them with their cultural- lingusitical superiority . Today, those who are responsible for killings and lootings are sitting on the streets or get killed. Many Pashtuns have lost everything and live under the right of existence. The Mohammadzai were known to be wealthy and very rich and giving Afghanistan it´s ruling class with it´s royals, but today they do not differ from Kuchis and the drug-infected people of Kabul or Hazaras of Behsud or Tajiks of Kandahar. The same things I am writing here I always tell to my own friends and relatives. Let´s stop these idiocy and work together. Our own hearty people will deal with our criminals and you need to do the same with yours. Those who devided Afghanistan were fascists or servants of foreigners.

      "Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.  \"\n",

      "\":Following the initial Jeremiah Wright controversy, a consensus version of the events was worked out. It was an extremely unpleasant and tortuous experience that involved neutral and \"\"pro-Obama\"\" editors bending over backwards to accommodate 3 anti-Obama editors who wanted to make a as big a deal as possible out of Wright's ravings. The \"\"negotiation\"\" took weeks to accomplish, even with the timely assistance of an impartial and thoughtful administrator. Kossack is trying to restore this particular version, but he has embellished it with provocative sub-headings, and enhanced it by conflating it with Ayers-related BS. What he fails to understand is that the Wright controversy has now passed into history, and is no longer significant. It had no overall effect on the primaries, and Republican attempts to use it in a recent special election backfired. Therefore, an abbreviated summary is all that is now needed, and curious historians can read all the gory details in the exhaustive sub article and the related biography - as I mentioned earlier.    \n",

Here it is http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bench_press&direction;=next&oldid;=5794667 Taking out the record would be a shame. The reason there is a difference in the Guinness record and lifts sanctioned by less notable organizations is that there are different rules on what technique constitutes a lift, if equipment is allowed to aid the lifter, and if performance enhancing drugs are tested for. If you take away all rules and judging, then anyone can claim the record. Aaron's home run record does not include the home runs he hit in the negro leagues. Josh Gibson is not the HR record holder. You can't just go out to your local gym, alert the media and complete the lift. It has to be judged by an existing set of regulations. What is a lift? Is there a pause on the chest? Can the athlete use legs to push? Can they be on drugs? Who tests? How often? Who weighs the official plates that were used? Does it have to be a standard bench? Are you allowed to put bungee cords under your lifting shirt? When is the lift complete? Lucky for us there is already an organization, recognized by the world, that takes care of all there rules and regulations. The argument is simple. If you want to be considered the greatest quarterback of all time, you compete in the NFL, the highest governing body of that sport. Powerlifting and other sports like it have International Federations and that fact should be recognized here.\n",

Both women claim that his penis is 9 inches in length.[1]\"\"  A- Nowhere does it say in the referenced article that he is 'among the largest'.  B- Reference is from a chat forum and there is no proof that these postings are actually by those that have been quoted, only that they are using those usernames.  C- Those quoted, while possibly may be quite sexually experienced, doubtfully have tape measures inside their vaginas.  Measurements should source from scientific resources, not \"\"assumptions\"\" and estimations, otherwise this adds to the vibe of a fansite.      His girth is also very large and is estimated to be at least 6 inches at the mid shaft.  \"\"Very large\"\" is subjective in tone and \"\"estimated\"\" offers no source or factual data.  Estimated by whom?  When?  According to which scale?    \"\"Ashley is known for his exceptional sexual skill, which allows him to make his female co-stars consistently orgasm. A great deal of Ashley's performances have led his co-stars to experience multiple orgasms through a combination of expert cunnilingus, fingering and thrusting techniques. In addition, he has made many starlets ejaculate, most of whom had never ejaculated before. First-time female ejaculators with Ashley include starlets such as Teagan Presley, Nadia Nyce, Jada Fire, and even Tianna Lynn who has since gone on to feature her copious ejaculation abilities in many other films. The above is COMPLETELY without source or verifiability.  A-  \"\"Expert sexual skill\"\" according to whom? What exactly is a \"\"thrusting technique\"\"?  Who determines status of \"\"expert\"\" cunnilingus?  Did he participate in the Olympic Cunnilingus Team Qualification Rounds?  Did he minor in Thrusting technique at Harvard?  B-  Female pornography actresses have been know to fake their orgasms.  Consistently.   Also have been know to lie about the pleasure they received in their performances to SELL THEIR PRODUCT, lending even more to the tone as a fansite.

I look over it  I see it's been documented and footnoted almost to the very last comma. I observe a tremendous argument ensuing over one word, \"\"cult\"\", that's being interpreted multiple ways. Multiple editors are squabbling over whether User:Ste4k is being \"\"POV\"\" for using it. I change the wording to eliminate the troublesome word while meeting what I see as the intent of the original author of the quote, Garrett. I think I do an adequate if not very eloquent job. I go to a lot of effort to explain what and why I made the change, citing the dictionary, etc. I do screw up and forget to sign some of my work, which you helpfully catch and fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then vote in the AfD to delete the article but to keep its content and merge it into the main article. I explain my reasoning, but without going into detail as to my views of both articles as they presently stand. If I had, I would have said something along the lines that the main article flows well and is comprehensive; I think it's generally well written. At the same time, it screams out for about 200 {{fact}} tags. It's not clear to me how reliable it is. The book article, by contrast, is not as pretty and, as the principal author herself more or less says, reads like a U.S. District Court decision. There's a reason judges' decisions are not high literature and that's because they're shooting for reliability and precision, not memorable prose. There's considerable overlap between both articles with much discussion as to whether there should be a book article and a movement article or just one combined article; there's even discussion as to whether the word \"\"movement\"\" should be used. It seems to me as it all this talk of different articles is putting the cart before the horse (reliability), so I vote \"\"merge and delete\"\" so that the overall Wikipedia coverage can get fixed and streamlined with some sort of consensus built.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I wake up and I find that you've spent hours during the night sarcastically mutilating your own article. It appears that one word, \"\"cult\"\", and my good faith editing of its usage may have been your tipping point to go into a frenzy. That or my one vote in the AfD process. If you don't like my cult edit, just reverse it and explain how I got it wrong.\n",

      "\"\"I'm not originally from the U.S. I was born in Kharkov. In our country, we beat liars, and if one wants to eat, they work. The only POV in that article I wrote was that I wanted to find out the truth, did research, marked it with citations for verifiability, refused to consider any source that came from some primary provider, and all I found out for my trouble was that this encyclopedia isn't even worth quoting.

      "And as for Wikipedia, being flawed, it certainly is that. It is profoundly flawed in terms of the reliability of some of its material. In fact, if so many millions of people didn't use it, I'd say forget about it. But the fact is, Wikipedia is very important and growing in importance everyday. Every day, more people abandon traditional sources of reliable information such as Britannica and turn to Wikipedia. Every month, Wikipedia's Google rankings move up higher and are often in the top 5 for a given search. The fact that so many other sites such as answers.com mirror the content makes what's written in Wikipedia seem all the more \"\"reliable\"\" since to the undiscerning, it looks like other sites are agreeing with Wikipedia.\n",

The election victory of Hamas in the Gaza-strip allowed the party to rule the power on to the Palestinian people since 2006. Also the Hamas party is doing charity works for the poor, disabled and children. I can not believe that this party still has not been removed of the list of terrorist organization by the United States, European Union and Japan.

That would indeed be stupid, as there is no reason at all to suppose that there is any correlation between apparent loudness and damage.

Assessing music is something yet again, and since it is sometimes noise-like and sometimes pure tones it really needs something more complex than a weighting curve, based on proper combination of the outputs of a bank of narrow band filter.\n",

People from one culture would know a certain type of music, or certain steps; and while there was some overlap in a few cases, the different steps were very confusing to those who didn't know the dances.  Also confusing was the fact that even in the case of overlap between cultures, the steps had differing names.\n",

      "Thus, the country dance caller was created out of necessity.

So in Subotica its OK, but i dont see any reason that Novi Sad should be an expect with 4 % Hungariens. With this you will start an revolt in the articles about Croatian cities with Serbian population till 5%. Same rigth for all. Why you want to destroy the peacfull consense and situation again with this? Why? I'm sick of nationalists and traitors. This is WP, not Nadopedia or No such Userpedia, and when in Vukovar not can stay the Serbian name, although the Serbs are there over 25%, so, after WP-rules and consense they can not stay in Novi Sad also. And also without this, they can stay there in the infobox for Novi Sad, because the Hungarians are there only 4%. Novi Sad can be an expect. I told you we hafe a section Name for this, but you dont want ti accept, spo who make the problems here??? Thats not OK from your side, realy not.  \"\n",

For example, Santiago de las Vegas grew because of the importance of the tobacco plantations, Havana had (and still has) tobacco factories. Havana was the most important port of the Spanish Empire in America, and the cities around also enriched because of that fact. Havana's growth swallowed all those cities around, and nowadays they seem to be one and only city, but this is only apparent. Even nowadays, when someone who lives in Marianao borough or district crosses the Almendares River, which is the border, he/she always says \"\"I'm going to Havana to shop\"\". Anyway, you can merge both articles, or write one article for Havana and do the same for the rest of the disctrics. By the way, the population of Havana City Province of 2.2 million people, are from the last census of 2002. In ten years, the population have grown, for sure.\n",

      "This is how I would propose to lay out material on a subclass of semirings, in this case complete star semirings.  Firstly, define complete semirings and star semirings, each with a set of examples  Finally define complete star semirings, again with a set of examples.   In this case continuous semirings are closely related to complete semirings, so it makes sense to include them: an additional motivation here is that this emphasises the relationship between partial orders defined on the semirings and the star structure: for example, Conway uses the order approach to prove Kleene's theorem in his 1971 book.  Of course there are choices here.  For example, should the examples of complete star semirings be introduced early on, or only after the last definition?  There's no right answer to that.  I would like to see examples of a concept which are not examples of the richer structure, folloewd by examples of the richer structure.  Examples of continuous semirings would have been helpful, but as some editors have said, there is no deadline.  In my view, a definition without an example is hugely preferable to no definition at all: the reader in search of information will still be able to see what sort of thing it is and find references to further resources on the subject.  That, it seems to me, is what an encyclopaedia is for.\n",
      "The current state of the material seems to me to be intended to do one thing only, which is to introduce complete star semirings in a way which makes the star operation as close as possible to the traditional Kleene star.  This is not the only approach.  A reason for the axiomatisation and separation out of the various properties is the entirely reasonable mathematical activity of finding out which of the properties of the Kleene star derive from what assumptions.  On the way, various structures of interest emerge, and various theorems are proved about the relationships between them.  That may not suit the point of view that star semirings are \"\"really\"\" or \"\"completely unsurprisingly\"\" the original formal languages: but that's only a point of view; it isn't correct, or at least, isn't the whole truth; and it isn't helpful to the reader of the encyclopaedia.      \"\n",

      "You say of calling Northern Ireland a \"\"country\"\": \"\"It would cause uproar, not only among nationalists but among different strands of unionism in Northern Ireland too, and would be very much contrary to the supposed spirit of the \"\"new Northern Ireland\"\". It is this highly politicised tone that I am objecting to. Where do British Unionists object to NI being called a \"\"country\"\" in the sense of Wales et el? When you say \"\"the supposed spirit of the \"\"new Northern Ireland\"\" you seem to be essentially claiming that the new Northern Ireland is more a part of the Republic of Ireland than in was before. The reality is that NI is now less part of the UK, and less part of the ROI. As I write, the episode of 'Coast' on Northern Ireland is on TV, and it is just reminding me of how the NI article is Wikipedia's most shamefully negligent article: something I proved with examples over a year ago. It is bereft of locality and positivity. The more recent generations in NI expect a country to grow up in, not an abstract story, or a 'nowhere place' - they have one in every needed sense, except the minds of those who need to put their on need and idea of nationalism first.   \n",
